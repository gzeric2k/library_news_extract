              <div class="document-view__body">Poking through the embers of 2014 reveals a slowburning year heavy on chatter and light on action, writes Joe Aston.<br/>
         <br/>In 1994, blockbuster action flick, Speed, hit cinemas. Twenty years on, writing Rear Window is just like driving that bomb-rigged Los Angeles city bus. If your pace falters even ­momentarily, the whole thing blows sky high. Full tilt is the only hope of success and/or survival, and ­assistance is rendered by superiors whose sirens shepherd us through dicey ­intersections and hazardous obstacles.<br/>
         <br/>
Unfortunately I'm no Keanu Reeves , my sidekick Will Glasgow looks nothing like Sandra Bullock and we haven't grossed $350 million at the box office, so that's where this analogy ends.<br/>
         <br/>
Summing up a calendar year becomes more difficult the longer you do it. With a few exceptions, they all start to resemble each other. But 2014 was a kind of holding year, remarkable more for the amount of talk than the amount of action.<br/>
         <br/>
All of this calendar's great totems were slow-burn affairs – Network Ten's journey to market, the ABC's fallout with the Abbott government, Vocation's fallout with ­investors, and Daily Telegraph editor Paul Whittaker's fallout with reality. Gone are the days when flaming out took just a few days! Except perhaps in the instance of ­billionaire James Packer and Nine boss David Gyngell duking it out in Bondi, but even that fuse had been burning a while. And Ian Thorpe coming out. Knock me down with a feather. My first editor remarked to me at a cocktail party 10 years ago: "Ian is the Rock Hudson of this generation." Glad I remembered that one . . .<br/>
         <br/>
As always, faces changed, but not with the morbid enthusiasm of the previous year. Cameron Clyne vacated the helm of National Australia Bank and Gail Kelly is preparing to do the same at Westpac. Lazard investment banker John Wylie retired too. Leighton's Hamish Tyrwhitt and Peter Gregg were executed by those rampaging Spaniards in March, but made off with the loot. Virgin Australia chair Neil Chatfield stepped down and is still to be replaced, while both AMP and David Jones have been relieved of Peter Mason 's services as chairman. Ron Radford departed the National Gallery and in March Andrew Demetriou announced he was leaving the AFL, but not before a parting gift for his foes at News Corp Australia: in February, as we'd predicted, their former boss Kim Williams was appointed an AFL Commissioner.<br/>
         <br/>
In Canberra, there was not a single leadership challenge! Despite feral commentary and eye-watering backstabbing at the end of the year, federal politics was remarkable mostly by virtue of its stability. Well, everything's relative, and Rudd-Gillard-Rudd left a hell of a low bar.<br/>
         <br/>
Yes, the budget sell job was messy. And Tony Abbott wasted valuable political ­capital on extraneous policy – such as a war on the ABC and reform of the Racial Discrimination Act – to placate a few conservative commentators who already supported him. That didn't win the PM a single vote and ended with Alan Jones , Andrew Bolt and The Australian newspaper birching him anyway. Julia Gillard made the same ­mistake playing to feminazis and mummy bloggers. There are few swinging voters on the ideological periphery of politics and the centre has no interest in culture wars.<br/>
         <br/>
The path to redemption for the Coalition is in crafting its every message through the prism of economic security, then lather, rinse and repeat. Which is precisely what the PM's reshuffle seems designed to enable, with talk of welfare policy as "economic ­participation" and the efficacious Josh Frydenberg installed as Assistant ­Treasurer. Arthur Sinodinos may be in exile for a while yet but his counsel on strategy should be kept regularly at the highest level. And the nagging diplomacy in the Senate, whose most skilful practitioner is Mathias Cormann , must continue.<br/>
         <br/>
Nevertheless, disunity is death: it's a ­cliché because it's true. The visceral feeding frenzies on Abbott's chief of staff Peta ­Credlin and Treasurer Joe Hockey are hopefully done. The PM's Office merely serves the PM and he is now listening. So his frontbench has no excuse not to stem its panic (or, in some cases, treachery) and get on with that mantra: economic security.<br/>
         <br/>
In this feature last year, we predicted Ten Network's disastrous foray into breakfast television would be over by Easter. It was axed in May. We floated Alexander Downer going to Washington as our ambassador. Instead, like his father, he was posted to London. For that, he can blame his relationship with Chinese telco Huawei – not a favourite of US intelligence agencies. We suggested Google Australia's foray into ­creating its own content. It didn't happen in 2014 but it will in 2015.<br/>
         <br/>
Despite the stubborn rumour, UBS ­rockstar banker Matthew Grounds went nowhere, nor did Crown Resorts CEO Rowen Craigie (although he does report to a new co-chairman: Grounds's former UBS colleague Rob Rankin). And Qantas boss Alan Joyce had four-fifths of a horror year, force-feeding the airline some ugly ­medicine, yet by November he was announcing an upgrade to profit guidance and blue skies ahead. Clearly, Canberra was right to make him sink or swim, refusing him a debt ­guarantee. But his success has given his ­tenure plenty of breathing space. Following this month's management shake-up, Gareth Evans looks like the internal successor, moving from CFO to run Qantas's ­international and freight divisions and beefing up his operational CV.<br/>
         <br/>
While the Australian economy hardly roared along, investment bankers had their best year in a long while: $41.4 billion of equity was raised on the ASX, up 62 per cent, including $17.8 million in initial ­public offerings.<br/>
         <br/>
The biggest bonanzas for our Masters of the Universe were the Medibank Private and Healthscope floats, the trade sale of ­Queensland Motorways, Shell's $3.2 billion block sale in Woodside and the restructure of the Westfield empire. The Lowys alone paid $70 million in fees to the investment banks. Bonus time!<br/>
         <br/>
But, as always, there were a few ­headaches. UBS was burned badly ­underwriting Arrium's undersubscribed $754 million capital raising. And Citi wore fried egg after an aborted attempt at a block sale in Veda for major shareholder PEP.<br/>
         <br/>
JPMorgan is lagging Down Under and is under considerable pressure from New York. Watch this space.<br/>
         <br/>
Caliburn founders Ron Malek and Simon Mordant (or what's left of him!) are free to compete with their former masters Greenhill early in the new year. Nobody will be surprised to see them hang out a new shingle. It will also be interesting to see what star broker Charlie Aitken does in 2015, having joined Bell Financial's board this year only to leave it soon after.<br/>
         <br/>
Gordon Cairns joined the Macquarie board on October 31. Presumably, he's Kevin McCann 's preferred successor as chairman – the two men share a healthy respect and the same happened at Origin Energy. Nothing's imminent, but it would have implications for who is to succeed Nicholas Moore as chief Millionaire.<br/>
         <br/>
Mercifully, things settled down in our industry – at least compared with 2013, a year of seismic profit collapse and CEO changes at Ten, Seven and News Limited.<br/>
         <br/>
In the publishing industry there are still polar views on print decline and digital ­sustainability. Print whisperers point ­stoically to the stubborn premium on print ad rates but fail to account for the higher costs of printing and distribution. One side will be proven triumphantly right and the other catastrophically wrong. Prayer time?<br/>
         <br/>
Rupert Murdoch spent a week in Sydney in December, meeting with senior management and editors. There is every chance that Peter Tonagh will soon be named to ­succeed Julian Clarke as Australian CEO, although APN News &amp; Media's Michael Miller is a wildcard. Ten boss Hamish McLennan , tied up with the network's sale process, has long coveted the top Holt Street job (as has The Australian's editor in chief Chris Mitchell ). After the hospital pass that was Ten, McLennan may return to ad ­buying. Hey, it worked out well for Harold Mitchell and McLennan is still well regarded by industry leaders such as Seven's Kerry Stokes .<br/>
         <br/>
What does the future hold at News for the Tele's Paul Whittaker? His brazen ­front-page advertorials would sit more comfortably on daytime television (NutriBullet, anyone?). There's a Grand Canyon between being commercially savvy and selling out.<br/>
         <br/>
The problem for Boris? He doesn't have Mitchell's grasp of the subtleties of politics, his tabloid instincts are profoundly inferior to Col Allan's (or indeed The Courier-Mail's Chris Dore), he lacks the charisma of John Hartigan , the larrikin editorial humour of David Penberthy has utterly bypassed him and, to boot, he's a total punish to be around. Apart from that, he's a wonderful embellishment to Murdoch's empire!<br/>
         <br/>
How much fire is left in the belly of Nine's David Gyngell ? Clearly, he'd rather be chairman than CEO, and pull the strings from Byron Bay, but who'd be mad enough to take the job under him?!  Anyhow, Gyng will have to stay another two years if he's to make off with his full post-float incentives and a big deal on regional television is still in his, and the board's, sights.<br/>
         <br/>
As much as Fairfax's Roger Corbett and Greg Hywood would love to pull off a deal with Nine, it won't be countenanced by the network while we're still printing ­newspapers, and that's a while yet.<br/>
         <br/>
What Hywood did pull off, on the stroke of Christmas, was a merger with John ­Singleton's Macquarie Radio Network. ­Analyst consensus had valued the entire Fairfax radio division at $110 million. But Fairfax made off with $78 million for one Perth FM station, another $18 million in cash and 54.5 per cent of a merged national talkback powerhouse worth an estimated $200 million. Worth a Maserati or three?<br/>
         <br/>
By the way, we never meant any of that mean stuff we said about 2GB stars Alan Jones and Ray Hadley – they're both stand-up fellows and it's about time we focused on the positives!<br/>
         <br/>
2GB and Fairfax is a textbook odd couple and everyone will be treading very carefully while the dust settles on this new bloc. But how incredible that Singo, Jones and Hadley – for so long in political and commercial lockstep with the Telegraph – are now in business with News's archenemy Fairfax. Team Singo insists none of this changes their love and affection for Holt Street. But how long will News buy that line?<br/>
         <br/>
Our real media bugbear for the year was book publishing. The market was swamped in 2014 by turgid memoirs. Pity the fortunes of those trying to market quality fiction. We especially tip our cap to Melbourne ­University Publishing's Louise Adler , who treated us to yet another publicity tour by look-at-me TV producer Adam Boland and a list of Kim Williams ' favourite things.<br/>
         <br/>
Pity the trees who died for that! MUP made a whole $93,163 in calendar 2013, down 85 per cent on the previous year, but we'll have to wait until April to see their accounts for 2014.<br/>
         <br/>
The precipitous Q4 fall in the oil and iron ore prices spelled disaster for ­mining and energy stocks. Since ­September, Santos has more than halved in value. Origin, Karoon Gas and Beach Energy have all been hammered, as have Fortescue, BHP, Atlas, BC Iron and Arrium. Yep, the resources boom is toast. Compounding their pain, BHP totally botched the messaging of its demerger plans for non-core assets, playfully dubbed CrapCo but now known as South32.<br/>
         <br/>
It was a very bad year for some. Barry O'Farrell ? Say no more . . .<br/>
         <br/>
Vocation CEO Mark Hutchinson arguably misled the market in August, denying a funding suspension which had been in effect since July. It subsequently tapped investors for $74 million in new equity in September. Chairman John Dawkins is gone. The CFO is gone. So is 90 per cent of the company's value and any faith from investors. Two shareholder class actions are in train. And Vocation has issued three profit downgrades in the last two months (the last snuck out on Christmas Eve). Yet, inexplicably, Hutchinson remains.<br/>
         <br/>
David Jones chairman Peter Mason tried to throw fellow directors Leigh Clapham and Steve Vamos under the bus for share trading that he approved. The nerve! All three fell on their swords and Mason also copped grief for the manner in which he disclosed a merger approach from rival Myer.<br/>
         <br/>
Myer's Bernie Brookes was leaving, then staying. With DJs snatched from him by the South Africans, and his ­margins being pummelled by the ­international retail invasion, Dural's second favourite son (after The People's Champion Ray Hadley) finds himself in a strategic cul de sac.<br/>
         <br/>
Woolworths boss Grant O'Brien goes into 2015 under huge pressure, with his Masters hardware division bleeding cash and in similar shape to the federal budget. Can he bounce back?<br/>
         <br/>
Divisive Murray Goulburn chief Gary Helou copped an adverse finding from the ad watchdog for running a ­racist TV commercial depicting ­bungling Japanese dairy executives. Gary The Great also has quite a few peeved farmers after his deal with Coles locked in $1 milk until some time after the Tehran Olympic Games.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury Wine Estates succeeded in boganising its most prestigious brand, Penfolds, with heavy discounting and free wine fridges.<br/>
         <br/>
And the big banking lobby, chaired by Gail Kelly , copped a s--t sandwich from David Murray 's financial ­systems inquiry while asleep on duty.<br/>
         <br/>
In a perfect world, 2015 would begin with a stabilisation in commodities and a February interest rate cut, then a rash of big infrastructure deals led by Mike Baird 's poles and wires, and a functioning federal Senate. Wesfarmers makes a big acquisition (AMP?) as Richard Goyder 's swansong before succeeding Mike Fitzpatrick as AFL chairman. BHP spins off South32 and Glencore comes back for a second tilt at Rio Tinto. Bankers get rich and I go home happy.

Happy holidays. Our editor in chief Michael Stutchbury will be researching his history of the Productivity ­Commission and writing folk songs about Glenn Stevens (regardless of the rate cut). The rest of us will watch some cricket and gorge ourselves on Neil Perry 's Christmas pudding. Enjoy.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Treasury Wine Estates is considering acquiring a United States business to give it access to a sustainable supply of quality grapes to try and bolster a revival, as part of the company's long term growth strategy.<br/>
         <br/>Chief executive Michael Clarke said it had a list of companies it was considering acquiring which would give it access to the best grapes.<br/>
         <br/>
"If we could get access to more luxury and masstige, i.e. top end grapes, that would allow us to even further step-change our growth rate in the luxury masstige part of the portfolio in North America and outside of North America," he said.<br/>
         <br/>
"The spot market works very well with commercial wine . . . but to get a regular supply of luxury masstige grapes on the spot market is very difficult . . . everyone is looking to get access to those grapes,'' he said after the Treasury annual meeting in Melbourne on Tuesday. Masstige is an industry term for a brand which sits between prestige and mass market.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Clarke said he was not interested in taking on any new brands, he only wanted access to the grapes.<br/>
         <br/>
"I'm not looking to buy a business that gives us brands, I'm not looking to buy a business that gives us infrastructure – we have that," he said.<br/>
         <br/>
He also signalled that Treasury was close to finalising some changes in the lower end of the troublesome United States business, where it would slim down its commercial brand portfolio.<br/>
         <br/>
"We are exploring some imminent opportunities to address the non-priority commercial brand portfolio," he said. This segment in the US represents between one to two million cases of lower-priced wines for Treasury, which he described as a "significant drag on our core portfolio''.<br/>
         <br/>
He would not elaborate on which brands were on the chopping block, but said they would be wines under the $US3 ($3.70) price point.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Clarke also outlined that of Treasury's 80-plus brands, about 15 have the potential to be what he calls "global umbrella brands" capable of being solid performers on the world stage.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Clarke, a former chief executive of British food group Premier Foods, was appointed to the top job on March 31, and has largely been applauded by shareholders for the changes he has made. The wine company's financial performance for the first half of 2014-15 is "on plan and ahead of prior year'', Mr Clarke told shareholders, as his fix-it plans and reinvestment in the business continue to bite.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Clarke said the solid progress in the first five-and-a-half months of the first half had been driven by the switch of the release of high-end Penfolds wines to October from the previous May 1 date, and reinvestment behind the major wine brands.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Clarke said he was "very pleased" by the release date switch.<br/>
         <br/>
"By moving it to October it allows us to capture those gifting occasions . . . and it's definitely happening around the world," he said. "In prior years we would release Penfolds in March and May which would result in them trying to sell as much Penfolds as they could in the last quarter of the financial year. That I felt was damaging the brand."<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury chairman Paul Rayner told shareholders he believed the board had done the right thing in terminating talks with private equity bidders earlier this year, with "clear feedback" from almost every major shareholder that a price of $5.20 per share undervalued the company.<br/>
         <br/>
"I am confident that [what] we did was right at every step of the process,'' Mr Rayner said.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury Wine's annual meeting is usually held in late October but was rescheduled months ago on the expectation it would coincide with a shareholder vote on one of the two private equity takeover proposals the company had received.<br/>
         <br/>
But the Treasury board on September 29 announced that it had ended talks with private equity suitors about a proposed $3.4 billion buy out after months of due diligence.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury shares closed down 4.56 per cent at $4.40 on Tuesday.</div>

Dreaming of a red Christmas<br/>
         <br/>
Australia's most iconic premium wine, Penfolds Grange, has been off limits as an ideal Christmas gift. The only time wine buffs could be showered with the famed Barossa shiraz is if the gift giver got ridiculously organised and snapped up a bottle when the winemaker traditionally released its iconic wines – in May.<br/>
         <br/>
This year marks a first for Penfolds. It ditched next May's release for its 2010 Grange and instead released the top drop on October 16. The decision was aimed at capturing Christmas sales and gift giving at Chinese New Year in February while smoothing out earnings for parent company Treasury Wine Estates.<br/>
         <br/>
It means this is the first Christmas you are able to waltz in to a fine-wine retailer and grab a bottle from the shelf.<br/>
         <br/>
The wine recently ranked second in James Suckling's top 100 wines list, beaten at the post by Argentina's 2011 Vina Cobos Malbec.<br/>
         <br/>
The 2010 Grange has so far collected three 100-point scores, from Tyson Stelzer, Andrew Caillard and Nick Stock, and is viewed by most critics to be superior to the 2009 Grange released earlier this year for the same recommended retails price ($785 a bottle).<br/>
         <br/>
James Halliday gave the 2010 Grange 99 points and said: "There is not the slightest question this will be one of the greatest Granges in the pantheon of '52, '55, '71, '96 and '06." With some astute buying, it can be found for about $650 a bottle.<br/>

              <div class="document-view__body">Grant Burge, the owner of Grant Burge Wines, which is in serious talks with Accolade Wines about a potential $50 million-plus sale of the fifth-generation Barossa Valley wine business, says the high Australian dollar has crimped profit margins.<br/>
         <br/>Mr Burge, who owns the company with wife Helen, said on Monday negotiations were delicately poised and the sale "could go either way".<br/>
         <br/>
The company generates annual sales of $45 million.<br/>
         <br/>
Accolade is 80 per cent owned by private equity firm CHAMP, with United States-based alcoholic beverages giant Constellation Brands holding the remaining 20 per cent.<br/>
         <br/>
Accolade, which is the renamed former BRL Hardy business, with brands including Hardys, Leasingham and Houghton, is involved in exclusive negotiations with Grant Burge Wines about acquiring the business.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Burge said the high Australian dollar had been hurting profit margins, although the company hadn't been hit as hard as some rivals because Grant Burge Wines has a large domestic focus. The company sells 450,000 cases of wine in the domestic market, and exports 150,000 cases.<br/>
         <br/>
But the strong currency had been an overall negative.<br/>
         <br/>
"It hasn't helped, for us it has certainly affected our margins in Europe," he said. He declined to comment on a potential price tag.<br/>
         <br/>
"It's not finalised so I'd rather not comment on that."<br/>
         <br/>
If a deal is struck, it would mark the second large transaction among big Barossa Valley winery companies in the past week.<br/>
         <br/>
Peter Lehmann Wines last week agreed to a $57 million buyout by Griffith-based Casella Wines, maker of the big-selling Yellow Tail brand.<br/>
         <br/>
Accolade said in a statement on Monday it was "in exclusive discussions to acquire the award-winning Barossa-based Grant Burge Wines".<br/>
         <br/>
"There is no guarantee that a final agreement will be reached as a result of the discussions," Accolade said.<br/>
         <br/>
Grant Burge Wines is a fifth-generation Barossa winemaking entity, with a history dating back to 1855.<br/>
         <br/>
The Burges took over running the business in 1988. They also own 400 hectares of vineyards.<br/>
         <br/>
Grant Burge Wines sells its flagship Meshach shiraz for about $180 a bottle.<br/>
         <br/>
The latest vintage is from the 2009 grape harvest and the company entered the top end of the market with that label almost two decades ago in an attempt to match it with other high-end premium wines, such as Penfolds Grange, owned by Treasury Wine Estates, and Hill of Grace made by the family-owned ­Henschke Wines.<br/>
         <br/>
The well-known Barossa region marks a gap in Accolade's offering.<br/>
         <br/>
The company has been without a Barossa brand since 2011, when it pulled out of the Barossa Valley Estate joint venture in which it had a minority stake. Barossa Valley Estate was ­last year bought by New Zealand-based Delgats.<br/>
         <br/>
The Australian Financial Review understands the companies hope to reach a decision either way before Christmas.<br/>
         <br/>
The latest set of accounts lodged by Grant Burge Wines with the corporate regulator covers the 2012-13 year and shows net profit was $264,247 from sales revenue of $43.2 million.<br/>
         <br/>
This compared with 2011-12, when net profit was $679,099, from sales revenue of $43.6 million.<br/>
         <br/>
Constellation acquired ASX-listed BRL Hardy for $1.9 billion in 2003 and privatised it, before selling 80 per cent to CHAMP in 2011 following a slump in profits.<br/>
         <br/>
Key points Winemaker says high dollar has hurt profit margins, especially in Europe. Sale deal to Accolade Wines 'could go either way', likely decision before Christmas.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Treasury Wine Estates is looking closely at other potential closures of smaller wineries to cut costs after announcing on Monday it will shut the 120-year-old Ryecroft winery in South Australia.<br/>
         <br/>The Ryecroft winery, in the McLaren Vale region, is running at about half of its capacity and produces a range of Rosemount labels.<br/>
         <br/>
The decision to shut the production facility marks the first major step in an overhaul of the company's processing infrastructure as Treasury chief executive Mike Clarke steps up his plans to strip more costs out of the supply chain. He wants to divert funds into investment in the company's major brands.<br/>
         <br/>
The shutdown of Ryecroft, which has 33 employees, means Treasury will be left with 10 wineries around ­Australia.<br/>
         <br/>
Most of the production of the Rosemount labels currently made at ­Ryecroft will be transferred to the Wolf Blass winery in the Barossa Valley, which is about 140 kilometres away on the opposite side of Adelaide.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury will transfer production from the Ryecroft facility in time for the 2015 grape harvest.<br/>
         <br/>
Company executives on Monday informed the 33 staff at the winery that it will be shutting, and meetings were held with unions.<br/>
         <br/>
Redundancies will be offered to those who can't find a job at other Treasury facilities.<br/>
         <br/>
Three very large processing sites operated by Treasury are the Wolf Blass winery, Penfolds, which is also in the Barossa Valley, and Karadoc in regional Victoria.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury's director of wine production in Australasia, Peter Taylor, said the decision was ''tough but necessary''.<br/>
         <br/>
"The decision to stop operating Ryecroft winery was an extremely difficult one,'' he said. The full closure of the ­Ryecroft winery was likely to take several months to be finalised.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Taylor said the production economics were not sustainable. "Rosemount wines previously made at Ryecroft will continue to source their fruit from McLaren Vale and surrounding regions, the only change is the location where the wine will be made.''<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Clarke joined Treasury as chief executive on March 31 and has had a torrid seven months. It included takeover proposals by two private equity firms, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and TPG. But the Treasury board terminated takeover talks on September 29 after it became clear the bidders weren't willing to pay a high enough price for the company, which also makes brands including Penfolds, Seppelt, Wolf Blass, Lindemans and Saltram.<br/>
         <br/>
Under Mr Clarke's overhaul strategy, there has already been a super-charging of marketing investment in Penfolds, the most profitable brand in the portfolio, and cost cutting in back office positions with 175 roles scrapped several months ago.<br/>
         <br/>
Ryecroft, which was bought by the Oatley family's Rosemount business in 1991, became part of Treasury through a series of takeovers.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">The managing director of Diageo Australia, which sells brands including Johnnie Walker, Smirnoff and Bundaberg Rum, believes Coles will eventually be able to reinvigorate its liquor retail business to be a much stronger competitor against rival Woolworths.<br/>
         <br/>Tim Salt, who runs the largest spirits maker in Australia, said that while Woolworths was currently the stand-out performer when it comes to liquor retailing, he expects Coles will be able to catch up in a similar way to its dramatic improvement in supermarkets.<br/>
         <br/>
"I wouldn't back against them, given what they've done in supermarkets,'' Mr Salt said.<br/>
         <br/>
Coles has outperformed Woolworths in supermarkets for a record 21 consecutive quarters, but in liquor retailing is a long way behind, as Woolworths powers ahead led by its flagship Dan Murphy's superstore chain.<br/>
         <br/>
The underperformance of the Coles liquor business has been a source of frustration for Coles's owner, Wesfarmers, for several years, considering the supermarkets business has made such strong advances since Coles Group was acquired in a $19 billion takeover in 2007.<br/>
         <br/>
Diageo Australia makes about 75 per cent of its total sales to liquor retailers, mostly to both Woolworths and Coles. The rest goes to bars, pubs and other licensed venues.<br/>
         <br/>
He said if Coles and other rivals to Woolworths such as the smaller independent chains also improved their performance, it would be a plus for suppliers across the board.<br/>
         <br/>
"It raises the game,'' he said.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Salt said Diageo had found the going tough in Australia over the past year, with consumer confidence still soft and volumes lower, even though there is a trend of "trading up'', where drinkers buy more premium brands. But that isn't enough to offset the lower volumes.<br/>
         <br/>
"People are drinking less but they are drinking better.''<br/>
         <br/>
He added Diageo Australia's sales revenue was down by 2 per cent in 2013-14 from the previous year's figure of $542 million. Net profit after tax was also marginally lower than the 2012-13 figure of $43 million.<br/>
         <br/>
However, consumers are still cautious. "We're not seeing a pick-up.''<br/>
         <br/>
The widely held view that spirits is a category which is immune from economic softness is just not right.<br/>
         <br/>
"The answer is, it's not true,'' Mr Salt said.<br/>
         <br/>
The company's ready-to-drink alcohol brands in pre-mixed spirits are suffering from an onerous taxation regime which is hurting growth.<br/>
         <br/>
"You're seeing continued erosion of the RTD segment.''<br/>
         <br/>
The first few months of trading in 2014-15 across the Diageo Australia business had been patchy and Mr Salt said it was too difficult to make a profit forecast for the full year.<br/>
         <br/>
"It's holding. We are where we want to be,'' he said.<br/>
         <br/>
Diageo Australia is preparing to launch a new product called Smirnoff frozen cocktail pouches this month, which is a 250 millilitre soft-pack selling for $5 each, in a pack of three.<br/>
         <br/>
The company is also gearing up for a traditional spike in sales over the next few weeks through Christmas gift packs of prestige spirits containing extra promotional specials such as two glasses.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Salt said Diageo Australia, which is part of the global Diageo Plc conglomerate based in Britain, won't be altering its tactics in the pre-Christmas lead-up because of a change in strategy by Australia's largest wine group, Treasury Wine Estates.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury, led by chief executive Mike Clarke, has aggressively overhauled its own approach by switching the release of its flagship Penfolds Grange to mid-October each year, ditching three decades of the previous timing of May 1.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Clarke's rationale is in part built upon the premise that Grange and other high-end Penfolds red wines will capture a large share of the pre-Christmas luxury goods gift-giving market.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Salt said Grange was a "wonderful product'' but is a small, niche player and Diageo would be focusing on its own business.<br/>
         <br/>
Key points<br/>
         <br/>
Trading has been tough this year as consumers go for quality over quantity.<br/>

              <div class="document-view__body">Treasury Wine Estates chief executive Mike Clarke has lashed disgruntled independent retailers upset about recent deals the nation's biggest ­winemaker has cut with Woolworths.<br/>
         <br/>In a stern defence of the winemaker's strategy, Mr Clarke said the company was offering fair terms to all of its retail customers and, in a sign that his ­turnaround plan was beginning to gain traction, trading so far this financial year had been strong.<br/>
         <br/>
Some independent retailers are ­furious with Treasury for allowing Woolworths – the nation's biggest ­liquor retailer – to participate in a wine fridge promotion in July, which they blame for stealing customers. They are also angry at a recent decision by ­Treasury, which makes Penfolds, Wolf Blass and Rosemount, to craft an ­exclusive label for Woolworths under its popular Pepperjack brand.<br/>
         <br/>
Woolworths' big box chain Dan Murphy's has sold the new Pepperjack shiraz cabernet for as little as $17.90 compared with the mid to high $20 mark independent retailers sell ­Treasury's Pepperjack shiraz label. "They are looking for easy volume in the chains," said one independent retailer.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Clarke hit back at the criticism, saying independent retailers received more exclusive labels from Treasury than the major chains. "I think sometimes they [independents] get upset when they see someone activate an exclusive better," Mr Clarke said. "Good on Woolworths if they have taken an exclusive and made it a good deal."'Principled' stance<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Clarke, who joined Treasury in March and has spent much of the year defending takeover bids, said the ­winemaker was being fair to all its customers. "I can assure you we have been principled in all our dealings with our retail partners, which I think is a new thing for this company," Mr Clarke said.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Clarke has embarked on an advertising blitz as he ramps up the winemaker's marketing effort to drive sales. It's his strategy that has gained the backing of shareholders, he said.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Clarke said a number of shareholders initially supported the board engaging with private equity bidders for a $3.4 billion bid but changed their minds after backing his turnaround plan. Treasury Australia and New ­Zealand general manager Angus McPherson said Treasury's sales this fiscal year were "on budget" but declined to provide specific details.Sector's healthy growth<br/>
         <br/>
Aztec figures show the value of the Australian wine sector grow 2.9 per cent in the year to August 3, but the value of Treasury's sales fell 3.2 per cent. Wine volumes nationally slipped 1.5 per cent but Treasury's plunged a staggering 9.2 per cent.<br/>
         <br/>
These figures take in to account a disastrous fiscal 2013 for Treasury, which lost sales after pulling back on promotions leading in to Christmas last year.<br/>
         <br/>
In the past, Treasury's wine fridge promotion has excluded Woolworths.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr McPherson said Woolworths ­initially declined to participate in the promotion because it wanted the deal exclusively, as did other retailers.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury refused to give exclusive terms to anyone. Mr McPherson said Woolworths later joined the promotion. A number of independent retailers said they did not sell as much wine as they had anticipated after Woolworths joined the fridge promotion.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury is releasing new exclusive Pepperjack labels with on-premise chains this week.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Veteran liquor retailers are being offered steep discounts on Penfolds Grange for the first time in 35 years in what they say is a move by Treasury Wine Estates to clear out excess stock of Australia's iconic premium wine.<br/>
         <br/>The Australian Financial Review spoke to numerous retailers across the country who confirmed they had been offered discounts of between 10 per cent and 30 per cent in the past few weeks to help move excess stock of the winemaker's 2009 Penfolds Grange.<br/>
         <br/>
"It's a cash discount," said one of the country's largest independent retailers, who asked to remain anonymous.<br/>
         <br/>
Asked if the retailer, who has been in the industry for 35 years, has ever been given a discount on Penfolds' flagship Grange product he said: "Never".<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury Wine Estates managing director Mike Clarke strongly rejected that the winemaker was not offering cash discounts for its 2009 Grange. But he said the winemaker had increased marketing and advertising support to retailers.<br/>
         <br/>
"I can assure you there has been no discounting of Grange at all," Mr Clarke told The Australian Financial Review.<br/>
         <br/>
"We have provided additional marketing support to help sell through the May release of our Penfolds icon and luxury wines. This is not pricing support and allegations of Treasury offering 10 per cent and 20 per cent discount on the 2009 Grange are utterly false."<br/>
         <br/>
The increased marketing spending is to help retailers adjust to a decision by Treasury to bring forward by seven months the release of its 2010 Grange, which is viewed by critics as better than its 2009 stablemate. Rather than release Grange and its Penfolds Bin range in May next year, Treasury released the wines on October 16, allowing the company to better smooth out earnings and attract consumers during the festive season and Chinese New Year in February.<br/>
         <br/>
But it meant retailers had to adjust to two releases of Grange in the one year. Penfolds is crucial to Treasury's performance, accounting for 70 per cent of profits. Advertising and marketing incentives typically cover adverts and in-store displays and merchandise.Documents obtained by this newspaper show a senior Treasury Wine Estates executive has offered one retailer a 30 per cent "rebate" in the past fortnight for bottles of 2009 Grange.<br/>
         <br/>
The retailer was charged $580 a bottle. But after paying for the bottle, the retailer receives a 30 per cent "rebate", which he said was a cash deposit in to his bank account that meant the average wholesale price he was paying for 2009 Grange was now $406 a bottle.<br/>
         <br/>
Including GST, the cost price for Grange is typically $638 a bottle. Penfolds recommends the wine to retail for $785 a bottle. Woolworths' Dan Murphy's is selling Grange for $679 a bottle. But some retailers said the wine had been sold for as low as $500 a bottle in recent weeks.<br/>
         <br/>
One retailer, offered a similar deal, said the company structured the discount as a "rebate" in order to keep invoiced prices for Grange consistent around the country."The discount will never appear on the invoice," the retailer said. "They protect the invoice price because if I get taken over by Woolworths, Woolworths looks at my accounts and goes back to Treasury and wants a 30 per cent discount for everything they have bought. So I send them a bill. It's a convoluted way of hiding a discount." The Financial Review spoke to retailers in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and Adelaide. "In the last 25 years that I have been doing this is the first time they have offered money on Grange," one retailer said. The retailer said he was being offered "bonus stock" and money for marketing and promotion."They can call it whatever they like. I call it a discount."Mr Clarke said most of the 2009 Grange and Bin wines released in May had been sold. But he said the winemaker was no longer trying to sell its entire production in the one year, instead holding on to stock that it could sell more profitably in future years. "We are not trying to sell everything in one year; even the current release," Mr Clarke said. "</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Luxury If you liked the 2009 in May, you'll be happy to buy the 2010 now. Or will you?<br/>
         <br/>Grange fatigue is a rare affliction among affluent wine buyers. But there are some in the fine wine retailing trade who are warning it may become more prevalent.<br/>
         <br/>
The latest version of Penfolds Grange, Australia's most famous wine, is set to go on sale next Thursday after a controversial shift in strategy by the brand's owner, Treasury Wine Estates, and its relatively new chief executive, Mike Clarke, who has just fended off a $3.4 billion takeover proposal.<br/>
         <br/>
It is the second version of Penfolds Grange to go on sale in the past 5½ months. The one coming out of the blocks on October 16 will be the 2010 version, which is highly regarded and from a grape harvest lauded for its quality. The recommended retail price is $785 a bottle, although the real price tends to be whatever is set by Woolworths' superstore chain Dan Murphy's thanks to its market power.<br/>
         <br/>
The sale will be close on the heels of the 2009 vintage, which was released on May 1 at the same price. Most experts regard it as slightly inferior when it comes to quality because of the poorer 2009 grape harvest.<br/>
         <br/>
Jules Gutierrez, the fine wine manager at North Sydney Cellars, says the prospect of Grange buyers feeling they've had enough is high. "My feeling is there will be fatigue,'' he says, adding that sales should still be brisk.<br/>
         <br/>
Gutierrez says other stablemates at the luxury end of the Penfolds portfolio priced well below Grange are also being aggressively marketed but for lower prices, and many drinkers believe they offer better value.<br/>
         <br/>
He also points to instances across the industry over the past few weeks where the 2009 Penfolds Grange was selling for $500 a bottle as stocks were cleared out in readiness for the 2010 version.<br/>
         <br/>
Two Granges in less than six months is a one-off as Treasury Wine, which also owns Wolf Blass, Rosemount and Seppelt, overturns its long-held strategy of releasing Grange on May 1 each year.<br/>
         <br/>
Clarke outlined the change months ago as part of a drive to ensure Grange is under consideration for Christmas stockings. Treasury hopes it might replace expensive bottles of whisky and other tipples as cashed-up buyers hunt for something special.<br/>
         <br/>
Chris O'Brien, the general manager of Liquor Barons, which runs 51 liquor stores in Western Australia, says the cachet of the Grange label will still draw in buyers even though they are being asked to open their wallets for a second time. He believes the amount of Grange allocated to Australian retailers is steadily declining, as Treasury puts energy behind turning Penfolds into a truly global brand in the luxury market.<br/>
         <br/>
"Grange is Grange. They will sell out year after year because of its reputation, investment credibility and its collect­ability,'' he says.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Takeovers Investors should know to wait for deals to hatch before counting chickens.<br/>
         <br/>More than $800 million in market value has been shredded from two ASX-listed companies, Treasury Wine Estates and compliance and quality assurance firm SAI Global, since proposed takeover bids by private equity firms amounted to nothing.<br/>
         <br/>
While shareholders in both com­panies are wincing, should they have been surprised? Private equity suitors in Australia have been breathlessly charging into boardrooms with non-binding and indicative proposals for potentially big takeover deals for more than a ­decade. But the latest misses add to an increasing sense that investors should be wary about the prospect of a change of ownership actually happening. The private equity firms vigorously defend their actions. The over-arching body representing their interests says there needs to be an overhaul of regulations and policies about when an initial proposal should be disclosed to the market. The Australian Private Equity and Venture Capital Association chief executive Yasser El-Ansary says on many occasions it is so early in the process and highly conditional, and price expectations are only a rough guide but taken as gospel by the market.<br/>
         <br/>
He points to the strong returns ­delivered by private equity firms to their institutional investors, which at 23 per cent for the 12 months ended March 31, outstripped the 13 per cent returns from the ASX 300, as the best yardstick for the disciplined nature of their work once they get under the ­bonnet of a company.<br/>
         <br/>
But big fund managers such as Perpetual's head of equities Matt Williams say it's natural for more cynicism to be building about the low number of deals that actually happen. Treasury and SAI are just the latest examples in a long list over the past few years, which has also included approaches to underwear and clothing maker Pacific Brands and his own firm, Perpetual. "I think private equity need to consummate a few more deals than we've seen lately for that sort of feeling not to perpetuate," he says.<br/>
         <br/>
"The more non-binding indicative bids that occur and don't amount to anything, the more cynical the market becomes about the whole process," he says.<br/>
         <br/>
The heavy falls in share prices of Treasury – which owns brands including Penfolds, Rosemount and Wolf Blass – and SAI – which administers the five-ticks quality standards mark as well as selling 7000 different sets of standards to industry – has, of course, been accelerated by the overall drop in the sharemarket in the past few weeks.<br/>
         <br/>
But the share price spikes that accompany the public announcement that a private equity approach has been made and then which stay built in for months as due diligence is completed, disappear quickly when no deal results.<br/>
         <br/>
US firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and rival TPG both did almost two months of due diligence on Treasury but in the end couldn't ­justify paying a high enough price to win over the board. Although KKR originally made an approach in mid-April, which wasn't disclosed to the ASX until a few weeks later in May, TPG was much later to the process.<br/>
         <br/>
In early August, they both signalled indicative proposals built around $5.20 a share. But after weeks of looking inside the company's inner workings and much more serious number-crunching they didn't end up getting that high, although KKR went close.<br/>
         <br/>
In the SAI case, Pacific Equity ­Partners made the initial approach on May 15 with a proposal in a range of $5.10 to $5.25. It also wasn't publicly ­disclosed initially, but SAI then disclosed it on May 26 to the ASX in a twin announcement which also revealed the shock exit of its chief executive Stephen Porges after just four months.<br/>
         <br/>
KKR then joined forces with PEP but in mid-September SAI announced there had been no whole-of-company bids, and the share price has been ­sinking since. It is currently wallowing at around $3.70. There have also been rumblings that the SAI board didn't over-extend itself in the due diligence process and didn't really want to be taken over anyway, but SAI defends the sale process as being a model one.<br/>
         <br/>
Perpetual's Matt Williams says fund managers do like to see market val­uations tested and have the opportunity to cash out in a successful takeover bid.<br/>
         <br/>
"As investors you always want the opportunity for the market to be tested," he says.<br/>
         <br/>
El-Ansary says Australia is a net ­capital importing country and global private equity firms take into account a vast number of factors including the regulatory framework when assessing potential buyout targets.<br/>
         <br/>
He says AVCAL thinks an overhaul of the disclosure regime is required, and it is about to undertake detailed work on the issue before making represen­tations to authorities and regulators in early 2015.<br/>
         <br/>
"Here in Australia we do have a somewhat unique approach to when things are made public. That does, in some ways, pose a challenge in that expectations are set very early on," he says.<br/>
         <br/>
El-Ansary says it is difficult having to put forward a highly conditional ­proposal with pricing indications so early in a process, and then have that publicly aired prematurely.<br/>
         <br/>
This leads to an assumption by shareholders that a binding offer may take place at that level, even though boards of target companies do warn that there is no guarantee a formal bid will occur.<br/>
         <br/>
"There's a question here that needs to be asked about what is the right model."<br/>

              <div class="document-view__body">It's been a tragic time for Peter ­Lehmann Wines.<br/>
         <br/>In late June former managing ­director Doug Lehmann died just a year after his famous father and company founder Peter Lehmann lost a long ­battle with kidney disease.<br/>
         <br/>
But the Barossa Valley company has stayed on course to deliver improved sales and profits, with sales of its ­bottled wines particularly strong in Australia.<br/>
         <br/>
Peter Lehmann Wines produced a 75 per cent increase in net profit to $754,000 in the 12 months ended June 30, 2014, while revenue improved by 13 per cent to $47.9 million.<br/>
         <br/>
The company is 86 per cent owned by Swiss-based wine and hotels ­business Hess Group and still has a total of about 450 shareholders. It remains an unlisted public company since a $149 million takeover by Hess in 2003 meant its listing disappeared from the Australian stock exchange.<br/>
         <br/>
The annual financial statements for 2013-14 have just been lodged with the corporate regulator in Australia and they show that on September 26, 2014, the company began a new ­financing facility with GE Capital. The five-year agreement contains facilities totalling $22 million.<br/>
         <br/>
Peter Lehmann Wines chairman Christoph Ehrbar said in the ­company's financial statements that domestic sales had climbed by 39 per cent to $22.8 million.Exchange rate difficulties<br/>
         <br/>
"The domestic market now ­represents 61 per cent of our overall ­bottled sales," he said.<br/>
         <br/>
But the high Australian dollar meant export sales had had a difficult time, particularly to the United States.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Ehrbar said overall revenue from exports was down by 17 per cent and North American markets represented more than half of that decline. The ­company had made substantial changes to its distribution network in Canada to sales and was closely ­scrutinising its arrangements in the US.<br/>
         <br/>
"We are currently reviewing our strategies in the US,'' he said.<br/>
         <br/>
Hess Group is the company's ­controlling shareholder with 86 per cent. The estate of founder Peter ­Lehmann holds 10.4 per cent and among the shareholders are grapegrowers from the Barossa Valley.<br/>
         <br/>
Doug Lehmann, who was managing director for 17 years until mid-2010, was deputy chairman until his death from a heart attack on June 29 this year.<br/>
         <br/>
The company opted not to pay a ­dividend for 2013-14 and instead focused on paying down debt, which has been reduced by 25 per cent. It has $16.6 million in franking credits available for use for future dividends. During 2012-13 the company breached banking covenants and was forced to negotiate a new banking facility with National Australia Bank. At June 30, 2014, the loan facility with NAB was $15.1 million.<br/>
         <br/>
The increase in profit and revenues is a welcome event for shareholders after such a difficult period for the company with the deaths of Peter and Doug Lehmann in a short time, although profits are well below those the company made five years ago.<br/>
         <br/>
Peter Lehmann Wines made a net profit, after tax of $3.8 million in 2009-10, then showed a decline to $1.01 million in 2010-11 before plunging to a loss of $520,000 in 2011-12.<br/>
         <br/>
It returned to the black in 2012-13, making a net profit after tax of $430,000.<br/>
         <br/>
The decline in the Australian dollar over the past few weeks is set to be a plus for Australia's wine exporters, both small and large. Treasury Wine Estates, owner of Penfolds and Wolf Blass, ­outlined in mid-August that it benefits by about $2.3 million for each 1¢ drop in the Australian dollar versus the US ­currency.<br/>
         <br/>
The Australian dollar has fallen nearly US8¢ since the start of ­September, and is now sitting at a ­four-year low.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">TPG's Project Fitzpatrick had some expert advice from ex-Foster's wine men, but KKR's Project Southern Cross offered higher value.<br/>
         <br/>A towering figure loped into the United States head office of Treasury Wine Estates in the picturesque Napa Valley wine region in California in mid-August. As a potential $3.4 billion takeover loomed, the presence of Pete Scott, a former chief financial officer of Foster's Group, was an intriguing twist to an already complicated private equity play for the locally listed wine producer.<br/>
         <br/>
Scott had been the chief number-cruncher for the Australian beer and wine giant from 2002 until early 2008 when he was based in Melbourne.<br/>
         <br/>
Strolling into the Napa Valley office with Scott was Walt Klenz. Klenz is also a person very familiar with the inner workings of Foster's and the Beringer wine business in the US. The US is at the centre of Treasury's troubled times over the past 18 months and its poor performance in that region is part of the reason why Treasury found itself fending off takeover bids. Klenz had in the 1990s been the chief executive of the same Beringer business in California which Foster's paid an eye-popping $2.9 billion for in 2000 to dramatically expand its global wine operations.<br/>
         <br/>
Scott and Klenz both live in California and run the Vincraft Group. They were two secret weapons enlisted by private equity firm TPG as part of its "Project Fitzpatrick'' tilt to try and over-take rival firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in a battle to produce a winning bid of up to $3.4 billion for Treasury.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury split off from Foster's in mid-2011 to become a separate entity, with wine brands including Penfolds, Wolf Blass, Rosemount and Lindemans, plus the large US wine business led by the Beringer brand.<br/>
         <br/>
Ultimately both KKR and TPG have come up empty-handed for now after an exhaustive due diligence process, Treasury will continue on as an ASX-listed company. But it has a much deflated share price.<br/>
         <br/>
More than $460 million has been wiped from the Treasury market capitalisation since the board led by chairman Paul Rayner officially announced on September 29 it had ended talks with both suitors because they wouldn't pay the price tag the board wants.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury's board and advisers from Goldman Sachs led by investment bankers Christian Johnston and Zac Fletcher, who code-named their defence Project Kingdom, had a large amount of input from offshore fund managers who own stakes in Treasury.<br/>
         <br/>
They included Wellington Management, Capital Group and Harris Associates. Those fund managers were convinced that even at the indicative price outlined in early August of $5.20 per share the private equity firms would be racing off with Treasury at the bottom of the cycle.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury chief executive Mike Clarke spoke to many of them on post-results investor ­roadshows overseas after the company's unconvincing full-year results on August 21.<br/>
         <br/>
They were buoyed by the latent value of large amounts of Penfolds wines in storage due to come out onto the market over the next two years, plus a weakening Australian dollar which lifts the bottom line by $2.3 million for every one cent drop against the US dollar.<br/>
         <br/>
A series of phone hook-ups were then held with fund managers in the days leading up to Friday, September 26, most of whom thought $5.20 per share undervalued the company. Treasury set a 5pm deadline on September 26 for the suitors to show their final wares, to try and bring matters to a head. KKR was closest to the $5.20 mark with its indications of value, and had its financing completely locked in under the deal, code-named Project Southern Cross. It was well ahead of TPG. TPG wanted an extra week to see if it could get to the upper end of a range it had been working in of $4.50 to $4.70 per share. It was refused.<br/>
         <br/>
A pre-arranged Saturday morning Treasury board phone hook-up was reminded of the resolute view of big shareholders that $5.20 wasn't enough. But had KKR really played its last hand? Was this part of a broader tactical game? There were further phone calls between advisers over the weekend seeking absolute finality.<br/>
         <br/>
After one last re-read and check by company boffins early on Monday September 29, Treasury fired off an announcement to the ASX, revealing the plug had been pulled. It had been an exhausting and distracting six months since KKR first approached Treasury.<br/>
         <br/>
Nomura's joint head of investment banking John Hanson, and its executive chairman Peter Meurer worked closely with KKR and its junior partner Rhone Capital. KKR's Hong Kong-based ­consumer expert Steve Ko, and KKR's Australian boss Justin Reizes were closely involved.<br/>
         <br/>
A profit downgrade by Treasury on January 30 originally sparked KKR into action. It made an initial approach in mid-April, which wasn't publicly disclosed until a few weeks later by Treasury. The prize, if secured, would sit in KKR's Pan Asian Fund II, a monster $6 billion fund hunting across Asia for good deals.<br/>
         <br/>
There was extraordinary cross-over in specialist advisers used by both firms. KKR enlisted the help of former Coca-Cola Amatil managing director Terry Davis early in the process. Davis was running Foster's wine business in 2000 when it bought Beringer for $2.9 billion. Scott, an American who was finance director for Beringer at the time of that acquisition, then shifted to Australia to work for Foster's in 2002, while Klenz in late 2001 took over running Foster's entire global wine operations while still based in California. Klenz was abruptly put into that role when Davis left Foster's to begin his 13-year stint running the CCA soft drinks business.<br/>
         <br/>
TPG had been eyeing the Treasury business for more than three years. Project Fitzpatrick, named after former Carlton premiership captain Mike Fitzpatrick in the AFL, who is now a Rio Tinto director, has been alive since 2011. TPG is understood to have made an approach to Foster's about buying a stake in the Treasury wine business just before the de-merger of Foster's in May, 2011, but was spurned.<br/>
         <br/>
The glitz of showbiz also cast its shadow in the sales process.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury's chief executive Clarke walked into Goldman Sach's Los Angeles headquarters at Fox Plaza on the Avenue of the Stars in LA in early September for a lengthy five-hour meeting with up to 60 bankers and financiers from TPG's bid team. At that point things were getting very serious. Treasury itself on August 29 announced it was delaying its annual meeting for shareholders because it may need to coincide it with a scheme of arrangement meeting where shareholders would vote on a buyout deal.<br/>
         <br/>
High-flying Los Angeles is in stark contrast to the Builders Arms Hotel in the trendy inner Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy. In all of the high-stakes negotiations, there was room for a laugh. Soon after TPG came roaring into the bidding process with a $5.20 indicative offer on August 11, Clarke, his chief financial officer Tony Reeves and TPG's key Australia executives Ben Gray and Simon Harle were invited to a dinner by Goldman Sachs bankers to foster good relations. The location was locked in at the Builders Arms. It was discovered only at a late hour they didn't have Treasury wines on the wine list. Some hasty BYO of Treasury's finest was organised.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury shareholders though won't be laughing much now. The shares are wallowing around the low $4.20 mark. That is despite the company revealing on September 29 that trading was ahead of budgets on revenues and gross profit after the first three months of 2014-15. A week ago the shares were $4.92. The private equity suitors have vanished for now, but there is a strong sense among many in the market they could make a return.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">One of Treasury Wine Estate's top executives says it will continue to benefit from an oversupply of grapes in the Australian wine industry over the past 10 years.<br/>
         <br/>Stuart McNab, Treasury's global supply and production manager, says the oversupply of grapes has been a plus for Treasury because it lowers input costs. He says it is likely to continue, although it is hard to predict for how long. "It's not normal to stay in oversupply for 10 years," he said.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr McNab says the company's strategy is to tilt towards higher-priced luxury and premium wines.<br/>
         <br/>
The company's vineyard self-sufficiency ratio is at about 25 per cent, which means it buys many of its grapes from outside growers. Treasury has 83 wine brands in its portfolio, including Penfolds, Wolf Blass, Rosemount, Wynns and Lindemans, and is the world's largest stand-alone stock exchange listed wine company.<br/>
         <br/>
He says it's difficult to forecast when supply and demand might move back into balance because of factors such as the size of grape harvests in other countries and the determination of local independent grape growers who might be running at a loss.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr McNab said many grape growers were reluctant to exit the industry even if they were uneconomic because there were few alternatives.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury's board on Monday announced it was ending talks about a proposed $3.4 billion buyout. This came after an exhaustive due diligence process where Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and junior partner Rhone Capital, and rival bidder TPG Capital, investigated the inner workings of the company but couldn't pay what the company's major institutional shareholders wanted. Treasury shares have fallen 14.4 per cent from $4.92 since the rejection on Monday morning.<br/>
         <br/>
Chairman Paul Rayner said about half of its share register by aggregate didn't think a price of $5.20 per share was enough. This was despite indicative proposals made in early August by both private equity firms at the $5.20 per share mark, which allowed them to conduct due diligence.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury announced on August 29 a delay of its annual meeting, expecting it would be held to coincide with a scheme of arrangement meeting in which Treasury shareholders would vote on a takeover bid.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr McNab said the Australian grape crush over the past few years had been averaging about 1.8 million tonnes, although there were seasonal fluctuations, and it was unusual that supply remained so high with so many grape growers making a loss. "They've stayed in production but at a much lower capital base," he said.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Treasury Wine Estates chief executive Mike Clarke and one of his senior ­executives are assessing up to five ­different options before making a final decision on an internal structure likely to include a separate sales and marketing arm for the company's top-end wine brands.<br/>
         <br/>They are aggressively moving to "unzip" them from the more commercial wine brands, which will also have a dedicated sales and marketing force which is likely to be in place by the end of the year.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury has also singled out several commercial brands in its troubled United States operations as "non-priority'' but won't divulge which ones they are, as it attempts to move higher up the value chain and divert more investment into the luxury end of the market. The non-priority lower-priced brands may be sold, or funnelled into a joint venture structure.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Clarke is working closely with the general manager of Treasury's Australian and New Zealand operations, Angus McPherson, on what Mr Clarke terms the unzipping project to put more grunt behind the higher-priced wine brands and obtain better returns from the commercial portfolio.<br/>
         <br/>
The initial separation will be confined to the Australian market and some of the commercial brands in the United States, but then broaden out across the entire US operations.<br/>
         <br/>
The duo are assessing a number of different models for the structure internally, with a separate sales and marketing unit devoted to brands like Penfolds, Wynns and the higher-priced Wolf Blass labels, and one for the commercial brands.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Clarke has been holding a series of "town hall''-style meetings in Melbourne with Treasury staff over the past 48 hours along with phone briefings for the major Treasury overseas offices following the announcement by the board that it had ended talks with private equity suitors about a proposed buyout after months of due diligence.<br/>
         <br/>
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, with junior partner Rhone Capital, got closest to an indicative $5.20 per share value in final proposals last Friday, but TPG Capital was some way lower. Treasury shares slipped further on Tuesday to close 5.8 per cent lower at $4.24. It has lost 14 per cent in value since Monday morning in the wake of decision announced by chairman Paul Rayner that many of Treasury's large institutional shareholders believed $5.20 per share undervalued the company.<br/>
         <br/>
The structural changes inside Treasury are part of Mr Clarke's fix-it plans after a series of heavy write-downs and profit downgrades over the past few years prior to his arrival on March 31. The Penfolds brand in particular will receive more investment spending to try and turn it into a global luxury brand, while the release date of new vintages for the flagship Grange and other high-priced Penfolds labels is being switched to mid-October to cash in on the pre-Christmas market.<br/>
         <br/>
Credit Suisse analyst Larry Gandler said the reason the buyout transaction failed "was because there was no silver bullet to unlock significant value and rapidly retire debt or partially fund the transaction''.<br/>
         <br/>
UBS analyst Craig Stafford has a 12-month price target of $4.33 on Treasury and recommends investors sell.<br/>
         <br/>
No silver bullet<br/>
         <br/>
Reasons the private equity deal failed<br/>
         <br/>
Divesting brands probably could not realise significant value because of their low margin or declining revenue profile. (Rosemount or Lindemans, for example.)<br/>
         <br/>
Divesting geographies such as US probably would have resulted in complex licensing and distribution arrangements, or alternatively revealed diseconomies of scale.<br/>
         <br/>
Rapid inventory depletion of luxury wine without replenishment, while cash generative, would not have been beneficial to the long-term health of the Penfolds brand.<br/>
         <br/>
Cash generating capability of TWE is scant given that growth objectives require working capital and acquisitions.<br/>
         <br/>
Availability of tax losses turned out to be an unimportant value factor.<br/>
         <br/>
A sale and leaseback of key vineyards would have been unlikely to unlock significant value.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">The threat of intervention by regulators on high-risk mortgage lending is not keeping bank chief executives awake at night but it adds to the uncertainty hanging over the majors at the moment.<br/>
         <br/>Three of Australia's big four banks have a September 30 financial year end and will sign off on another 12 months of record profits on Tuesday.<br/>
         <br/>
But the prospect of a repeat performance in the current year is less assured.<br/>
         <br/>
A decline in bank stocks has been a major contributor to the Australian ­market's 6.4 per cent fall in September, although a lot of this is to do with offshore investors putting their money elsewhere now that United States interest rates are set to rise rather than a problem with ­fundamentals.<br/>
         <br/>
But the regulatory threats coming from all fronts are not helping sentiment either and the banks admit life is about to get a lot tougher than it has been in the past.<br/>
         <br/>
David Murray's report into the financial system and G20 agenda dealing with the "too big to fail" issue raise the prospect of tougher capital requirements for Australia's banks.<br/>
         <br/>
The surge in property prices in parts of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane is ­creating another issue for the banks to ­contend with if the Reserve Bank decides the economy can no longer afford a hands-off approach when it comes to risky lending.<br/>
         <br/>
The banks are opposed to the ­introduction of macro-prudential controls which could impose restrictions on loan-to-value ratios, something New Zealand has been doing for a while with mixed results.<br/>
         <br/>
While Australia is unlikely to go down the New Zealand path, the Reserve Bank has put the issue back on the agenda after flagging the prospect of measures to tackle "unbalanced" lending.<br/>
         <br/>
This could include forcing banks to increase capital against certain types of loans and assessing lending requirements based on potential future interest rate rises. This could mean providing a buffer by assessing a home loan application on the ability to repay a loan at a higher future ­interest rate instead of the 5 per cent actual rate currently.<br/>
         <br/>
While there was a collective groan around bank boardrooms last week when the central bank flagged the possibility in its financial stability review, bank chiefs have remained tight-lipped on the issue.<br/>
         <br/>
This is partly because it is unclear what the RBA and APRA will do and it is too early to make a formal assessment of the potential risks to their lending profiles.<br/>
         <br/>
The challenge for banks is to avoid a knee-jerk response to a series of what-ifs. They are also confused about how a crackdown on lending would fit into anything that emerges from the Murray inquiry.<br/>
         <br/>
The banks are also hyper-sensitive about talking up an issue and scaring away investors at a time when their stock is on the nose.<br/>
         <br/>
Macro-prudential control is not a new idea. It regularly crops up in conversations with bank chairman and chief executives and the RBA and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority.<br/>
         <br/>
Some bank executives say privately they are not worried about the issue, taking comfort from previous interaction with the RBA where it indicated an unenthusiastic approach towards intervention.<br/>
         <br/>
They also argue better quality control is good for them as well and that their own loan-to-value ratios have come down a fraction anyway.<br/>
         <br/>
The banks will also argue macro-prudential controls are a waste of time if you are applying restrictions to loans covering all geographies when the rampant growth in prices is confined to particular types of properties in Sydney, Melbourne and parts of Sydney.<br/>
         <br/>
There is a case though for targeted intervention in loans for investment properties, particularly those with high debt levels which pay interest only. The signs are that first home buyers would not be considered high risk.<br/>
         <br/>
The banks will also point out comments by the RBA last week that the risk from the current strength in housing is more likely to be future household spending than to their own balance sheets. Interest rate rises may impact a consumer-led economic recovery because many Australians will funnel any discretionary funds back into servicing their home loan .<br/>
         <br/>
Banks will also argue they already have an interest buffer on residential home loans. A 225-basis point interest rate buffer already applies to many home loans but could also be applied to investment properties.<br/>
         <br/>
Bank chiefs are a conservative lot and they won't want to rock the boat on this sensitive issue until there is more clarity.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury Wine Estates boss Michael Clarke has his work cut out for him as he finally sets the winemaker on a solo course after months of ownership uncertainty as the private equity sharks circled.<br/>
         <br/>
TWE and suitor Kohlberg Kravis Roberts have decided to part ways after being unable to a agree to a deal which valued the company at the $5.20 a share the board wanted.<br/>
         <br/>
TWE chairman Paul Raynor and Clarke pulled the plug on talks over the weekend after realising KKR was not willing to come to the party with a $5.20 per share offer.<br/>
         <br/>
The other bidder in the mix, TPG Capital, was offering a figure well south of that and both bidders had their own regulatory or funding issues which were going to make a deal even harder to get away.<br/>
         <br/>
The onus is now on Clarke to prove the sceptics wrong and show shareholders his turnaround strategy can deliver greater value than the potential $3 billion-plus offers that were proposed.<br/>
         <br/>
Clarke and Raynor have been opposed to a takeover from the beginning but did the right thing by agreeing to engage after rejecting an initial low-ball offer.<br/>
         <br/>
Differences around strategy, forecasts, valuation and regulatory obstacles for the bidders were listed among Treasury's reasons for wrapping up the talks with KKR and TPG.<br/>
         <br/>
This was a surprise to the market which had been betting on a deal getting through after years of on-again, off-again takeover talks. The the other surprise was news from the TWE camp that just under half its shareholders believed a $5.20 a share offer undervalued the company.<br/>
         <br/>
Certainly, the market saw value in an offer at that level and Treasury shares are now down 8.5 per cent now that the takeover premium has been stripped out.<br/>
         <br/>
If half of TWE's shareholders were in fact willing to reject a $5.20 bid it would say a lot about how the market views a company's fundamentals these days. Shareholders will always agitate for a higher offer but traditionally have been happy to accept a private equity cash offer f there is a half decent premium involved.<br/>
         <br/>
Clarke is desperate for a chance to implement his turnaround strategy and did not want talks dragging on until Christmas if there was no certainty of getting a deal away.<br/>
         <br/>
He has been complaining for months the process was hugely distracting for the company and that he wants a chance to get on with it without the uncertainty of an ownership change cramping his style.<br/>
         <br/>
The pressure is on. Investors have high expectations now that an offer of $5.20 was within their grasp.<br/>
         <br/>
There are positives in Clarke's plans to shuffle the release dates of Penfolds premium wines and cut back the number of brands in the stable but the jury is still on out on whether it can repair the value ­erosion from some bad decisions by former management.<br/>
         <br/>
TWE says the private equity bidders endorsed Clarke's strategy and believes there was not a lot of additional taking the company private would bring.<br/>
         <br/>
It is back to the drawing board for KKR, which has been unable to land that big Aussie deal that has also made bids for fund manager Perpetual and Coles Myer. Buyout firms are hungry for deals but only at the right price now that the heady pre-2007 days are well and truly over.<br/>

              <div class="document-view__body">Treasury Wine Estates had $275 million wiped from its market capitalisation on Monday after terminating talks with two private equity suitors, with chief executive Mike Clarke saying he doesn't believe they will return with a fresh proposal.<br/>
         <br/>"I think it's over, is my point of view," Mr Clarke said.<br/>
         <br/>
The Treasury boss also hinted at "opportunities for inorganic changes within our organisation" including bolt-on acquisitions at the luxury end of the market in the United States, small divestments and potential alliances to help accelerate a turnaround. This is on top of his fix-it plans already outlined several months ago.<br/>
         <br/>
The Treasury board led by chairman Paul Rayner is backing those fix-it plans by Mr Clarke, who joined the company as chief executive on March 31. They include aggressively lifting investment behind the higher-end brands like Penfolds and stripping out $35 million in costs from back-office and admini­stration.<br/>
         <br/>
But the exit of Kohlberg Kravis ­Roberts, and rival TPG Capital, triggered a collapse in the share price.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury shares plummeted 15 per cent in early trade on Monday after the company said it had decided to scrap any more talks with bidders on potential buyout transactions, because the proposals weren't high enough.<br/>
         <br/>
The shares recovered however, and by the close were down 42¢ to $4.50, a slide of 8.5 per cent.<br/>
         <br/>
Wellington Management, the large Boston-based fund manager which holds 7.9 per cent of Treasury, is understood to be one of the large institutions backing the Treasury rejection, and part of the "clear feedback" received by Mr Rayner from investors who hold around 50 per cent of Treasury's share register. Most of the top 15 institutions have told Treasury that a price of $5.20 per share undervalues the company.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Clarke also said he was indifferent about whether Treasury was listed on the stock exchange or in private hands, because the most important thing was to have the right strategy and then deliver results for whoever the owner was.<br/>
         <br/>
"I'm indifferent as to whether we're publicly or privately owned," he said. Mr Clarke said in the first three months of 2014-15, Treasury was ahead of its financial budgets on a range of measures including sales volumes, ­revenue, gross profit and earnings. That was an early sign that the company can win back the trust of investors and ­consistently deliver what it promises after failing to do so previously.<br/>
         <br/>
"I'd like to crawl, walk and run and prove to shareholders that's what we can do," he said. Mr Clarke said the private equity firms had been unable to reach an acceptable price tag in their proposals, and so there was no point in continuing with discussions.<br/>
         <br/>
KKR and junior partner Rhone Capital are understood to have signalled late on Friday they couldn't reach the full $5.20 per share indicative level previously flagged on August 4, but outlined a range with conditions attached where the upper end was above $5 per share.<br/>
         <br/>
This put them well ahead of TPG. But the board wanted more.<br/>
         <br/>
It is understood that TPG's final proposal late on Friday was pitched broadly between a range of between $4.50 and $4.70 per share but with a condition that more work and time was required. This was well below its indicative proposal of $5.20 on August 11.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Clarke also said the level of Treasury's share price was for others to judge.<br/>
         <br/>
"My team and I clearly cannot manage the share price," he said.<br/>
         <br/>
But the due diligence process had proved Treasury was on the right path because both of the firms had validated the Treasury strategy, which gave the company more confidence.<br/>
         <br/>
TPG's bidding power was curtailed by regulatory issues connected with its ownership of casino assets in the US and tied house regulations around the ownership structures for licensed ­venues, hotels and bars.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">A 15 per cent plunge in the share price is a sobering lesson.<br/>
         <br/>The pressure on Treasury Wine Estates chief executive Mike Clarke – and his board, led by chairman Paul Rayner – to deliver a consistent and sustained improvement in profits over the next few years is immense.<br/>
         <br/>
With the help of some influential offshore shareholders, the board has decided that if private equity suitors Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts and TPG Capital are both fully behind what Treasury is trying to do with its own fix-it plans and the overall strategy, then there is little point in handing the keys over to them right now, rather than making the changes themselves.<br/>
         <br/>
But then there's the small matter of the takeover premium built into the stock for the past five months.<br/>
         <br/>
After the board announced on Monday that talks had been terminated, Treasury shares plummeted 15 per cent, but recovered about half the losses to be down 8.5 per cent at the close.<br/>
         <br/>
Building back that value will mean selling a lot of Penfolds, Rosemount, Wolf Blass, Wynns and Beringer, consistently, right across the globe over an extended time frame.<br/>
         <br/>
Both KKR and TPG indicated during due diligence that they thought Clarke was doing a good job, his plans were sensible and he was the right man to keep in place should they become the new owners.<br/>
         <br/>
Ultimately, they could get the numbers to work in the final number-crunching but not high enough to win over the board. Clarke himself says they were crimped by complex liquor, gaming and hospitality regulations, and issues around financing and the private equity model of putting more debt inside Treasury than the company currently faces. Rayner and his advisers sounded out institutional shareholders and the view was consistent: $5.20 was not enough.<br/>
         <br/>
The big question now is: Can the Treasury board deliver the goods? The business has been a difficult beast for more than a decade – in the past three-and-a-half years as a stand-alone wine group and before that as the wine division of Foster's Group. There have been a litany of stumbles and mis-adventures in an industry which is extremely capital hungry.<br/>
         <br/>
It is very early days, but as Clarke revealed on Monday, trading for the first three months is tracking ahead of plans. That's a small positive. And it's across all of the main trading regions around the world, including the troublesome US.<br/>
         <br/>
Both KKR and TPG in the end, submitted final proposals below their previous indicative proposals of $5.20 a share made in August. KKR is believed to have been close to the $5.20 mark in its final play, but that did not cut it. TPG was some way below that. It's worth remembering KKR's very first indicative proposal in May was pitched at $4.70. That price was at a 28 per cent premium to the one-month volume weighted average share price of $3.68 over the preceding weeks.<br/>
         <br/>
It's been a roller coaster ride but on paper, those patient, former Foster's shareholders who stayed put are still ahead, with the stock having traded at $3.45 on its first day as a stand-alone company on May 9, 2011. But in May, 2013 the shares were flying at $6.47.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Private equity giant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts is in the prime position to win a recommendation from the board of Treasury Wine Estates after lodging a bid significantly higher than rival firm TPG.<br/>
         <br/>The Treasury board is understood to have held KKR to a price of about $5.20, which values Australia's largest wine company at $3.4 billion. KKR and junior partner Rhone Capital offered that amount on August 4, up from the original solo KKR proposal of $4.70 which became public on May 20.<br/>
         <br/>
The board of Treasury and its advisers were still locked in high-level meetings on Sunday night as they approached a final decision, which may be announced to the Australian Securities Exchange as early as Monday.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury chairman Paul Rayner has been under intense pressure after a series of missteps at the world's largest stand-alone wine company over the past 15 months, with a change of ownership now highly likely for the owner of Penfolds, Rosemount, Wolf Blass, Wynns and Lindemans.<br/>
         <br/>
KKR and New York-based Rhone lodged a formal takeover bid for Treasury at around 5pm on Friday, while TPG also did likewise in time to meet a secret deadline put in place by the Treasury board and its advisers from Goldman Sachs.<br/>
         <br/>
The merits of each offer were closely examined by the Treasury camp over the weekend, with both bids ­understood to have a lower-than-usual debt component because of the unpredictable nature of the agricultural industry in which Treasury operates.<br/>
         <br/>
A spokesman for Treasury declined to comment on Sunday.<br/>
         <br/>
Both private equity firms lodged indicative proposals in August valuing Treasury at $3.4 billion and made separate official bids after an exhaustive and intense due diligence period over the past few weeks which included visits to offshore operations and wineries around Australia.<br/>
         <br/>
Both bids were pitched under a scheme of arrangement proposal.<br/>
         <br/>
The decline in the Australian dollar has played into the hands of the US-based private equity bidders, with each 1¢ drop delivering a $2.3 million injection to the company's profits.<br/>
         <br/>
The weaker Australian dollar delivered more financial firepower for the final bids because it makes Australian assets cheaper, with the maker of Penfolds and Wolf Blass increasingly likely to end up with an offshore owner.<br/>
         <br/>
While both KKR and its rival TPG are building in long-term projections for where the Australian currency is likely to be against the United States dollar for the next few years, most experts believe it will continue to fall, meaning the timing of the US predators is good as they look to rebuild profits should a bid be accepted by the Treasury board.<br/>
         <br/>
Stephen Harvey, chairman of Deloitte's Australian Wine Industry Group, said the local wine industry was in for a much better era when it comes to currency, with local exports to become much more competitive on the shelves of retailers in the US and the United Kingdom. "We're in a much stronger position,'' he said.<br/>
         <br/>
The Australian dollar slipped to an eight-month low on Friday hitting US$0.8772 briefly because of a slump in commodity prices and fears about Australia's growth prospects. This was its lowest point since February, 2014. It compares with a peak of US$1.10 in mid-2011, with the currency remaining ­stubbornly high for much of the period since then, before its bout of recent weakness.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury itself outlined some foreign exchange sensitivities on August 21 when it delivered its full-year results. Using a spot rate of US$0.93, it stated that a 1 cent change in the currency results in a $2.3 million impact on earnings before interest, tax and the SGARA accounting standard for 2014-15.<br/>
         <br/>
It also gave an outline of its foreign exchange risk management approach around hedging for the next two years for both the US dollar and British pound, but in practical terms analysts believe the $2.3 million impact is still around the mark when it comes to the US currency shifts. Stockbroking house Citi says the upside for the entire Australian wine sector is substantial from a sustained decline in the Australian currency, and for Treasury it will translate into better profit margins.<br/>
         <br/>
Citi analyst Gino Rossi said on Friday that demand from consumers in the United States for Australian wine is extremely sensitive to the level of the Australian dollar.<br/>
         <br/>
"US demand for Australian wine is highly sensitive to the Australian dollar and the US market alone is large enough to bring the Australian wine industry back into equilibrium. This will translate into higher wine prices and margins for Treasury,'' he said.<br/>
         <br/>
In 2006, Australian wine producers' total share of the wine import market in the US was 29 per cent at a time when the Australian dollar was at US$0.75. For the 12 months to the end of July it had shrunk to just 18 per cent.<br/>
         <br/>
Deloitte's Mr Harvey said during the past few years rival wine companies such as Argentina and Chile had made strong gains in the key US and UK markets at the expense of Australian producers because their own currencies were so weak and their bottled wine prices were extremely competitive on the shelves of liquor retailers in the US and Europe.<br/>
         <br/>
KKR and junior partner Rhone Capital lifted an indicative offer for Treasury on August 4 to $5.20 per share, while on August 11 TPG Capital made a proposal also pitched at $5.20 per share.<br/>
         <br/>
They both valued Treasury at $3.4 billion, with the rival proposals made via a scheme of arrangement where Treasury shareholders will vote at a meeting on a preferred bid.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Wine Since 2010, Australian Vintage has been wearing the pain of the high dollar.<br/>
         <br/>It has been a tough four years for Neil McGuigan, chief executive of Austra­lian Vintage. The high Australian dollar is eating into the company's export margins, making the already challenging job of running an unpredictable agriculture business even harder.<br/>
         <br/>
Profits from wine sales overseas are barely enough to keep the lights on back at its southern NSW Buronga Hill winery and processing plant.<br/>
         <br/>
But McGuigan has persisted, and by keeping Australian Vintage wines on the shelves and in front of wine drinkers in Britain, Canada and in the burgeoning Asian wine market, he has positioned the business to benefit from even the slightest movements of the currency in its favour.<br/>
         <br/>
"All we need now is a little bit of luck," McGuigan says.<br/>
         <br/>
Australian Vintage, maker of brands including McGuigan Wines, Nepenthe, Passion Pop and Tempus Two, has the sixth-largest brand in Britain by volume of wine sold and has the largest brand in Ireland. In August the company quietly announced it had signed a China-wide distribution agreement with COFCO Wine &amp; Spirits, part of state-owned COFCO, China's largest food processor and manufacturer.<br/>
         <br/>
Since 2010, when the Australian dollar reached parity with the US dollar, McGuigan and the Australian Vintage board have been gritting their teeth and wearing the pain to avoid forfeiting the foothold the business has established in overseas markets over the years.<br/>
         <br/>
"Wherever the exchange rate has moved against us it has hurt, but you don't want to walk away from the hard work you've put into building those brands . . . When the [British] pound moved below 69 pence [relative to the Aussie in March last year] that was very painful. It's been tough," he says.<br/>
         <br/>
Australian Vintage is leveraged to the movements of the currency as is any other Australian listed company. When the dollar moves in a favourable way it has a material impact on profitability.<br/>
         <br/>
The relatively lower Australian dollar in the last financial year, when compared with previous years, contributed to the 97 per cent increase in contribution that British branded and bottled sales made to the group.<br/>
         <br/>
The company's overall net profit increased by 49 per cent to $10.5 million in 2013-14 thanks to more favourable foreign exchange and growth in sales of branded wines over the less-profitable bulk wine business.<br/>
         <br/>
But the Australian wine industry has felt a lot of pain over the past few years. There is still a way to go before Austra­lian Vintage's shareholders can expect to reap the rewards of more favourable trading conditions, should the dollar continue to follow its recent trajectory.<br/>
         <br/>
In addition, the damage done by the oversupply of Australian grapes a decade ago still hangs over the heads of Australian winemakers.<br/>
         <br/>
Australian Vintage, formerly named McGuigan Simeon, has transformed itself over the years from a bulk supplier of wines to now making most of its wine for its higher-margin branded products. But McGuigan has tried unsuccessfully in recent years to secure a distribution agreement for branded wines in the United States, which he says will be essential to selling into the North American market.<br/>
         <br/>
Australian Vintage had an agreement with US-based E&amp;J Gallo to supply bulk wines until 2011, but the company has never been able to make a branded wine distribution there.<br/>
         <br/>
McGuigan believes the noise around the proposed private equity buyout of rival listed wine company Treasury Wine Estates (TWE) is not helping his efforts to position Australian Vintage's branded wines in the US. "Every conversation you have is about what's happening with TWE – what's going to happen with the ownership and what will happen to some of those brands," he says. "They're less interested in talking to us about our wine . . . [The buyout] needs to be resolved quickly and we need to get back to the knitting and talk about how good Australian wine is."<br/>
         <br/>
Under a KKR &amp; Co-led buyout it has been speculated in the media that TWE's Penfolds brand could be spun out and floated separately in the US.<br/>
         <br/>
After years of Australian winemakers either going bust or being bought out by larger companies, Australian Vintage is one of three remaining ASX-listed winemakers, next to Treasury Wine Estates and the much smaller Brand New Vintage.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Treasury Wine Estates chief executive Mike Clarke has held an exhaustive five-hour meeting in Los Angeles with about 60 high-level bankers and financiers who are central to TPG Capital's $3.4 billion buyout proposal for the owner of Penfolds and Wolf Blass.<br/>
         <br/>The meeting included a string of ­co-investors in TPG's funds and is one of the final steps in the due diligence process, with the Treasury board now likely to decide in the first week of ­October which of the rival private equity bidders it will move into ­exclusivity with, on an agreed deal.<br/>
         <br/>
Rival Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and its junior partner Rhone Capital are also in the last stages of their due diligence, with control of Treasury now almost certain to change hands in one of the biggest takeovers in Australia this year.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Clarke is understood to have been in Los Angeles for the high-powered meeting with TPG's financiers and bankers in the middle of last week where he outlined intricate details about Treasury's plans for a revival.<br/>
         <br/>
The sheer number of financiers and bankers involved in the meeting ­indicates the complexity of the financing arrangements, which are understood to revolve around a covenant-lite approach where the usual stricter banking covenants won't apply.<br/>
         <br/>
One source said Mr Clarke went into extraordinary detail in his presentation, with at least half of the bankers also physically present in the room in Los Angeles.<br/>
         <br/>
The fix-it plans include super-charging the Penfolds brand with heavy increases in investment, stripping out back office costs and attempting to blunt some of the power held by ­Woolworths and Coles in liquor retailing in Australia with more exclusive deals where certain lines are only ­available in one chain.<br/>
         <br/>
TPG financiers including JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley are thought to have been heavily involved in the LA meeting.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Clarke also went into detail about the upcoming release of the latest ­version of Penfolds Grange in mid-October, and the symbolism behind the shake-up at Penfolds as the company attempts to drive much harder the ­luxury credentials of the label on the world stage.<br/>
         <br/>
He also gave more details on how the Treasury business will be streamlined and the portfolio tilted further towards the higher-end and luxury brands, and away from the more ­commercial brands.<br/>
         <br/>
KKR and Rhone made an increased buyout proposal of $5.20 per share on August 4 and TPG followed a week later with a rival proposal pitched at the same price and with similar conditions.<br/>
         <br/>
Both TPG and KKR are proposing a deal done under a scheme of arrangement where Treasury shareholders will get to vote on the deal, and 75 per cent approval will be required.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury chairman Paul Rayner and his board a few weeks ago signalled to shareholders the annual general meeting would be delayed to coincide with a scheme of arrangement, provided an acceptable deal could be struck.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Takeover target Treasury Wine Estates has struck an exclusivity deal with Woolworths's Dan Murphy's liquor chain for a new wine under the Pepperjack brand, in the first major sign of chief executive Mike Clarke's push for some exclusive arrangements with Australia's two major liquor retailers.<br/>
         <br/>Striking more exclusive deals with Woolworths and Coles is one of the planks of a revival strategy for Treasury to generate better profit growth for some of the middle-range brands in its portfolio.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury is also in talks with Coles about potential deals for other labels which it intends selling only through Coles's Liquorland Australia chains: Liquorland, First Choice and Vintage Cellars.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury is the subject of two separate $3.4 billion buyout offers from private equity firms, both of which are nearing the end of a due diligence period after making indicative proposals of $5.20 a share.<br/>
         <br/>
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, in conjunction with junior partner Rhone Capital, lifted a previous buyout proposal of $4.70 a share to $5.20 on August 4, while rival TPG Capital made an indicative offer also at $5.20 a share on August 11.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury has struck a deal where the new 2013 Pepperjack shiraz cabernet is only available at a retail level at Dan Murphy's. The chain has started trumpeting the exclusivity in its advertising.<br/>
         <br/>
Dan Murphy's runs 188 stores around Australia and is a major profit centre for Woolworths's liquor operations which generated a 4.6 per cent rise in annual sales to $7.4 billion in 2013-14.<br/>
         <br/>
Dan Murphy's is also the market leader in online wine sales, with 46 per cent of the total market in Australia.<br/>
         <br/>
The Pepperjack wine will also be available from some Woolworths-owned BWS stores in November. BWS has 1200 smaller outlets around Australia, but the specific Pepperjack wine will only be confined to Woolworths-owned stores.<br/>
         <br/>
Pepperjack is part of the Saltram stable, one of Treasury's middle-range brands. Other derivations under the Pepperjack brand are available in other non-Woolworths liquor chains. But the new exclusive deal is an example of part of the strategy being used by Mr Clarke to drive more profitable growth for the Treasury brand portfolio, with analysts suggesting it may go some way to blunting the combined market power of Woolworths and Coles in liquor.<br/>
         <br/>
The bigger selling brands owned by Treasury including Penfolds, Wolf Blass, Wynns, Rosemount and Lindemans are quarantined from any exclusivity arrangements.<br/>
         <br/>
A spokeswoman for Woolworths liquor group said the company was pursuing further opportunities to expand the number of exclusive offers among the Treasury brands.<br/>
         <br/>
"The Pepperjack 2013 shiraz cabernet is exclusive to Dan Murphy's and is part of a continued review of other opportunities within Treasury Wine Estate's portfolio,'' she said.<br/>
         <br/>
A spokesman for Treasury said "we continue to work with all retailers across the portfolio to find opportunities that drive category growth, and deliver wines and brands to meet their shoppers' needs."</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Takeover target Treasury Wine Estates has flagged to private equity bidders that a substantial chunk of the $100 million earmarked for capital spending on the business this financial year is for "Project Uplift'' – a company-wide push to divert more spending into the production of higher-end wines.<br/>
         <br/>New chief executive Mike Clarke inherited Project Uplift when he was hired in March this year but has ­reaffirmed internally he is right behind the drive which began in earnest three years ago to lift the levels of investment in oak barrels, and spend more on improving vineyard quality and other infrastructure used to produce ­higher-priced wines.<br/>
         <br/>
Private equity firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and its junior partner Rhone Capital, and rival TPG Capital, are heading into the final fortnight of due diligence after both making indicative buyout proposals which value ­Treasury at $3.4 billion.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury, the owner of brands including Penfolds, Wolf Blass, Wynns, Rosemount and Lindeman's, spent $17 million on oak barrel purchases in 2013-14 and ploughed $9 million into luxury fermenters at Penfolds as part of broader capital spending of $98.4 million during the year.Capital spending<br/>
         <br/>
Capital spending is foreshadowed to be around $100 million in 2014-15. This compares with total capital spending of $124 million across the Treasury business in 2012-13 and $81 million in 2011-12 when Treasury split off from former parent Foster's Group in May, 2011.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Clarke is accelerating a push by Treasury to move higher up the value chain, led by Penfolds. Project Uplift has been undertaken across Treasury since the demerger to try to lift the ­company's ability to increase supply of high-end wines.<br/>
         <br/>
Peter Gago, chief winemaker for Penfolds, said the brand had proven resilient through a string of ownership changes. He is preparing for the release of the 2010 Penfolds Grange on October 16. This is a major shift from the ­traditional release date of the flagship wine in the Penfolds stable of May 1 each year and part of a deliberate ­strategy by Mr Clarke to better harness the long-term profitability of the brand by releasing it in the lead-up to the ­Christmas gift-giving season.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Gago said the quality of the 2010 Grange is impressive and it is one of the best he has been a part of in his 12 years as Penfolds chief winemaker.<br/>
         <br/>
"Internally, the team are talking about this being one of the best,'' he said. "We aren't crowing too much yet though, because it is up to others to judge these things,'' he said. But he added that the 2010 grape harvest had been highly impressive in its quality.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Gago also revealed that he hadn't yet had any discussions with either KKR/Rhone or TPG.<br/>
         <br/>
"I deliberately steer clear of that sort of thing."Indicative proposals<br/>
         <br/>
Both KKR/Rhone and TPG Capital have made indicative proposals pitched at $5.20 per share.<br/>
         <br/>
Paul Xiradis, head of equities at Ausbil Investment management said the fact that the Treasury board had on August 29 signalled a likely delay in the date of the company's annual meeting, indicated a transaction was looking more likely.<br/>
         <br/>
"It seems like all the ducks are lining up for that to occur,'' Mr Xiradis said.<br/>
         <br/>
Key points<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury Wine Estates is using Project Uplift to spend more on higher-end wines. Capital spending is foreshadowed to be around $100m in 2015-15.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">US private equity giant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts has severed ties with former Coca-Cola Amatil chief executive Terry Davis as it heads into the final three weeks of an extensive due diligence on the inner workings of Treasury Wine Estates.<br/>
         <br/>KKR and its junior partner Rhone Capital are understood to have now dispensed with the services of Mr Davis, who ran soft drinks and beer group CCA for 13 years until departing earlier this year.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Davis provided broad advice to KKR and Rhone on a range of behind-the-scenes aspects on the proposal to buy out Australia's largest ­winemaker.<br/>
         <br/>
It comes as KKR and Rhone move into the final stages of due diligence on Treasury. This process may be completed by mid-late September as KKR attempts to outmuscle rival bidder TPG Capital.<br/>
         <br/>
Both private equity firms have made indicative proposals pitched at $5.20 per share for the maker of Penfolds, Wolf Blass, Lindemans, Rosemount, Seppelt and Wynns. This values Treasury at $3.4 billion.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury shares closed 2¢ higher on Monday at $5.13.Support for Mike Clarke<br/>
         <br/>
Both private equity firms have been privately signalling they are right behind the fix-it plans of Treasury chief executive Mike Clarke for the company, which means there is a strong likelihood he will remain at the helm of the company should a change of ownership happen. Mr Clarke himself has said publicly he would like to remain in the job even under new owners, to finish the job of reinvigorating a company that had lost its way. His strategy involves dramatically increasing the amount of investment behind high-end wine brands such as Penfolds and Wynns, stripping out back office costs and shifting the release date of luxury Penfolds products to October each year, away from the original March to May release.<br/>
         <br/>
This switch will manifest itself in six weeks' time when Treasury will release its 2010 Penfolds Grange on October 16, bringing it forward almost eight months compared with the traditional release date, which would have been May 1, 2015.<br/>
         <br/>
The involvement of Mr Davis in the KKR/Rhone consortium had some in the market convinced he might be a potential future chief executive of Treasury, but KKR is believed to be heavily backing Mr Clarke's ­continuation.<br/>
         <br/>
The Treasury board has sent a clear signal to the market that a change of control is a strong likelihood, by foreshadowing on Friday that it wanted to coincide its upcoming annual general meeting with any scheme of arrangement meeting where shareholders will be required to vote to wave through any takeover.<br/>
         <br/>
This means the annual meeting is likely to be delayed beyond the originally scheduled date of October 30 this year.'No certainty' But it still left open the possibility that a firm, binding proposal may not eventuate.<br/>
         <br/>
"The board reiterates that there is no certainty that any proposal will result in an offer for the company,'' the Treasury board said in its note to the Australian Securities Exchange on Friday.<br/>
         <br/>
Both KKR/Rhone and TPG Capital have signalled they will use a scheme of arrangement in any final proposal.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Clarke and Treasury chief financial officer Tony Reeves are at the forefront of the internal deal team inside Treasury as the two private equity firms move into the final stages of due diligence.<br/>
         <br/>
Schemes of arrangement are increasingly the model for bidders in big takeovers.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">It started a week behind, but private equity firm TPG Capital is setting a blistering pace on due diligence at Treasury Wine Estates.<br/>
         <br/>It's been a whirlwind five days of management sessions as TPG puts the hammer down on what is shaping as a very serious proposal.<br/>
         <br/>
It is pushing hard to pull the rug out from under the original bidder, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, and its junior equity investor, Rhone Capital.<br/>
         <br/>
TPG – which, in a slightly cute way, is still referred to in official circles as an "unnamed" party in the whole chase for the owner of Penfolds, Beringer, Wolf Blass, Rosemount and Lindeman's – came into the ring on August 11, a week after KKR and Rhone went into the tent after lifting the buyout proposal to $5.20 a share.<br/>
         <br/>
So what has TPG been doing?<br/>
         <br/>
Some vigorous sessions with TWE management have been undertaken: one in California's Napa Valley where, thankfully, the earthquake didn't cause too much damage, three full-on days with Treasury management in the Melbourne headquarters, and one in the Barossa Valley in South Australia, at the biggish wineries and vineyards.<br/>
         <br/>
TPG's United States boffins were all over the US assets and are right behind the push by Treasury chief executive Mike Clarke to pick up some extra luxury wine assets, but only in a small way.<br/>
         <br/>
TPG is very keen on Clarke as the man to take the company forward.<br/>
         <br/>
Former Coca-Cola boss Terry Davis is still closely linked to the KKR / Rhone proposal, but there are mumblings in the market that Davis may not have the cosiest relationship with Treasury's biggest customer, Woolworths.<br/>
         <br/>
Woolworths, which of course unveils its own full-year results on Friday, runs Dan Murphy's, BWS and a big portfolio of pubs with gaming magnate Bruce Mathieson.<br/>
         <br/>
So being in sweet with it seems to be a prerequisite for any big supplier of beer, wine or spirits. TPG has all its ducks in a row when it comes to financing and number-crunching.<br/>
         <br/>
On the financing front, TPG has JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley, the Credit Agricole unit Calyon and HSBC in its corner.<br/>
         <br/>
JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank are understood to be the investment banks guiding TPG through the barrel halls full of good Penfolds red and top-end Wolf Blass grog.<br/>
         <br/>
At the more boring end, PwC is doing the accounting mumbo-jumbo.<br/>
         <br/>
But KKR / Rhone hasn't exactly been idle, either. It had a serious meeting on the financing front on Thursday.<br/>
         <br/>
TPG will hold its meeting with the banks in the next seven to 10 days.<br/>
         <br/>
Clarke is having a few well-earned days off after a ferocious few months where a buyout proposal was lobbed just weeks after he put his feet under the desk on March 31 at Treasury's Melbourne headquarters for the first time.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">A flat beer market and wine companies continuing to ship wine offshore in large bladders before bottling it in the United Kingdom is hurting Australia's largest glass bottle maker, Owens-Illinois, even though it returned to profit after heavy restructuring.<br/>
         <br/>Owens-Illinois Australia, which runs glass container plants in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Brisbane, has also been battling an improved performance from the $2 billion Amcor offshoot Orora which is taking market share from the No. 1 player.<br/>
         <br/>
Owens-Illinois shut down some glass furnaces at its Australian plants in early 2012 as the local trend by big wine companies to transport bulk wine in large bladders known as flexitanks to the UK where they are bottled for the local market, began to seriously bite.<br/>
         <br/>
The Australian operations of Owens-Illinois generated a 1 per cent rise in revenue to $876 million in calendar 2013, according to the latest financial statements lodged with the corporate regulator last month. Net profit reached $33.7 million for 2013 compared with a loss of $26.6 million in 2012 when the company undertook heavy restructuring.<br/>
         <br/>
The tough market conditions have continued in the past few months. Owens-Illinois global chairman and chief executive Al Stroucken said on July 29 in a conference call there was "ongoing weak demand in Australia".<br/>
         <br/>
A spokeswoman for Owens-Illinois Australia said on Tuesday the official statistics on beer consumption in Australia showed a flat beer market<br/>
         <br/>
"That does play a part," she said.<br/>
         <br/>
Owens-Illinois employs 1000 people in its four plants in Australia and administrative and sales operations. It operates a glass-making plant at ­Penrith in western Sydney, one at ­Spotswood in the inner-west of Melbourne, West Croydon in Adelaide and South Brisbane.<br/>
         <br/>
The directors of Owens-Illinois Australia said in the financial statements the results for calendar 2013 included "additional costs related to the closure of a furnace as part of the Australian footprint realignment program".<br/>
         <br/>
The ASX-listed Orora, which was spun out of Amcor in late 2013, signalled in its results released on Monday that it had been snaring market share in glass. Orora chief executive Nigel Garrard said Orora's Australasian operations generated a 26 per cent rise in earnings before interest and tax to $162.5 million and in the beverage packaging operations "gained market share in the glass division, while volume in the cans division was stable".<br/>
         <br/>
Owens-Illinois Australia, which also makes glass containers for products such as baby food and tomato sauce, made a profit before tax of $55.7 million in calendar 2013 compared with a pre-tax loss of $41.6 million in 2012.<br/>
         <br/>
The directors of Owens-Illinois Australia said they also liquidated three dormant subsidiaries in 2013 which were a hangover from the former ACI Glass packaging businesses they acquired in 1998 in Australia.<br/>
         <br/>
Australia's major wine groups ship large quantities of lower-end commercial wine to bottling plants in the United Kingdom and Europe in large bladder-type containers to save costs in a highly competitive export market which has been squeezed by the high Australian dollar.<br/>
         <br/>
A spokesman for Treasury Wine Estates said on Tuesday that it was the more commercial wine that was transported that way, while the higher-priced wines were bottled in Australia and then transported.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury, which owns Penfolds, Wolf Blass, Lindeman's and Rosemount among its 83-strong portfolio, is the subject of two separate $3.4 billion takeover bids.<br/>
         <br/>
Accolade Wines, which is 80 per cent owned by CHAMP Private Equity, ships vast quantities of commercial wine in bladders from Australia to a plant just outside London for bottling for the European market. Pernod Ricard, the owner of the big-selling Jacob's Creek brand, also ships ­commercial wine in bulk from Australia using bladders.<br/>
         <br/>
The parent company Owens-Illinois is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, has annual revenues of $US7 billion ($7.53 billion) and operates in 21 countries.<br/>
         <br/>
Key points<br/>
         <br/>
Owens-Illinois Australia hit by weak beer market and use of large bladders known as flexitanks to ship wine.<br/>
         <br/>
The bottle maker has also been losing share to an improved performance by ASX-listed Orora.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Treasury Wine Estates chief executive Mike Clarke says the company is on the acquisition trail in the United States at the premium end of the market, as he reinforced his desire to keep running the company even if one of the two private equity suitors takes control.<br/>
         <br/>He said momentum had improved in the troubled United States business and at the luxury end of the market Treasury had been caught out with a lack of supply in the US, which it wanted to rectify with acquisitions or alliances.<br/>
         <br/>
He also revealed that he thought Treasury's disappointing 2013-14 financial results represented a bottoming out, and improvement was on the horizon as his new plans for overhauling the company began to bite.<br/>
         <br/>
"I would hope there's upside from here," he said. But he declined to make a specific profit forecast for 2014-15.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury, which has received two separate $3.4 billion buyout proposals from private equity firms, earlier on Thursday revealed it had plunged to an annual bottom-line loss of $101 million after suffering heavy write-downs of $281 million. Mr Clarke said he wanted to continue as chief executive even if one of the private equity bidders were successful.<br/>
         <br/>
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and junior partner Rhone Capital made an increased bid for Treasury on August 4 of $5.20 per share, while TPG ­Capital made an offer pitched at the same price a week later. They are both doing due diligence.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Clarke and his chief financial officer Tony Reeves are heading the internal deal team for Treasury as the private equity firms clamber through the inner workings of the company.<br/>
         <br/>
"We're trying to absorb the brunt of the work," Mr Clarke said, to shield others from potential distractions.<br/>
         <br/>
When the write-downs were stripped out, Treasury's underlying earnings for the year declined 14.6 per cent to $184.6 million and the wine group was forced to rely on currency adjustments to reach a previously projected profit guidance band of $190 million to $210 million.<br/>
         <br/>
After adjusting for foreign exchange rates, earnings before interest, tax and the SGARA accounting standard was $193 million.<br/>
         <br/>
The biggest disappointment for the company was the Australian and New Zealand business, which suffered a 32 per cent slide in earnings to $75.1 million. The Asian operations also slipped 12.3 per cent to post earnings of $47.7 million. The company's troubled US business made a slight improvement when foreign exchange impacts were included, lifting earnings 12.1 per cent to $74.9 million.<br/>
         <br/>
On a constant-currency basis, the Americas dropped 7 per cent. The US has been a troubled part of Treasury and its predecessor Foster's Group for much of the past decade after Foster's splashed out $2.9 billion at the top of the market in 2000 for Beringer Wine Estates. To look for expansion in the US now under Mr Clarke may come as a surprise to the market. The company also revealed it didn't end up destroying all of the low-end commercial wine it had earmarked for destruction last year in the US after being caught with too much stock. Mr Clarke revealed it only destroyed 240,000 cases of wine out of an original plan to crush 600,000 cases, and was selling the remainder through other channels. Total sales up<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury, which owns Penfolds, Rosemount, Lindemans, Wolf Blass and Wynns among a collection of 83 brands, said total sales revenue for 2013-14 increased 1 per cent to $1.7 billion.<br/>
         <br/>
The write-downs totalled $385 million on a pre-tax basis and were $281 million on a post-tax basis.<br/>
         <br/>
Those impairment charges related mainly to reductions in the asset value of commercial brands, infrastructure and equipment, and information technology systems.<br/>
         <br/>
The write-downs were slightly higher than expected, with Treasury having outlined on June 25 that it would sustain write-downs of as much as $260 million for the year ended June 30. On that day it made no change to previous guidance of earnings of between $190 million to $210 million, as Mr Clarke revealed his own plans on that day to supercharge the Treasury business.<br/>

         <br/>As wine ages over the decades, some is lost through the cork (or so Fairfax's sommelier has told us).<br/>
         <br/>
If you have been gifted, say, a 1959 bottle of Grange by Nick Di Girolamo, you could be missing a few inches.<br/>
         <br/>
So pop along, have one of Michael Clarke's employees uncork and top it up with the appropriate vintage.<br/>
         <br/>
After all the trouble these bottles can cause, it would be a shame to waste it.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Global private equity firm Carlyle Group is inching closer to making a final decision about whether it should join the race for Treasury Wine Estates.<br/>
         <br/>It has been crunching the numbers behind the scenes and the noises out of Carlyle's Australian headquarters in George Street are that lift-off may be just around the corner.<br/>
         <br/>
The group is thought to be a believer in the abilities of Treasury chief executive Michael Clarke, who's been in the chair for four-and-a-half months trying to sort out the future of Penfolds, Rosemount, Lindemans and Wolf Blass. That makes potentially two private equity bidders who are likely to keep Clarke around should there be an agreed buyout offer with chairman Paul Rayner and his board.<br/>
         <br/>
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts is also a fan of Clarke having worked closely with him in mid-2013 after Clarke exited his chief executive role at Britain's Premier Foods. Clarke was an expert adviser to KKR when it was mulling a potential buyout of the nutritional drinks brands Lucozade and Ribena which had been put up for sale by pharmaceuticals behemoth GlaxoSmithKline. Japanese group Suntory eventually bought the two drinks brands for $2.5 billion in a process where Blackstone was also pushing hard for the acquisition.Clarke may yet be in the chief executive's office in Melbourne for some time yet.<br/>
         <br/>
That said, KKR is known to be working with former Coca-Cola Amatil chief executive Terry Davis , as revealed by The Australian Financial Review earlier this week.<br/>
         <br/>
Whether Davis secures the top job or is retained as an advisor should the Justin Reizes-led firm succeed remains to be seen.<br/>
         <br/>
It is unclear whether TPG Capital might potentially instal its own person into the Treasury chief executive job.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Private equity firms are canny investors but there is a crowning irony about TPG's pursuit of Penfolds producer, Treasury Wine Estates.<br/>
         <br/>Part of the winemaker's allure is its $2 billion worth of tax losses, which are attached to its US arm.<br/>
         <br/>
Depending on the structure of TPG's bid, the private equity firm could utilise these losses to offset a capital gains tax elsewhere, according to a number of experts in the field. Such a strategy would stand in stark contrast to the firm's controversial exit from the department store chain Myer in 2009.<br/>
         <br/>
Back then the Australian Tax Office triggered a long-running debate about the opacity of the private equity sector when it tried and failed to claw back $678 million from TPG in the wake of Myer's disastrous initial public offering.<br/>
         <br/>
A belated effort to freeze the buyout firm's bank accounts also proved futile as the money was funnelled off-shore.<br/>
         <br/>
The ATO finally conceded defeat in 2011 after the Federal Court overturned the tax watchdog demands that TPG pay what had swollen into $739 million in outstanding liabilities.<br/>
         <br/>
Adrian Varrasso, a leading tax specialist at Minter Ellison,who is not acting for any party in the Treasury race, confirmed the private equity suitors may ultimately deploy the winemakers' tax losses to offset capital gains tax in other corners of their empire.<br/>
         <br/>
However he stressed that each transaction is "fact specific" and the advantages may be limited given the restrictions likely to come into force.ATO's watching brief<br/>
         <br/>
He also predicted the ATO would train a beady eye on the ­Treasury transaction.<br/>
         <br/>
While TPG's rivals for the winemaker, KKR and Rhone Capital, may also be able to utilise the tax losses, Mr Varrasso claimed the "history" around the Myer float would mean the ATO is likely to keep a watching brief on any deal.<br/>
         <br/>
He added the two situations are not related and whether or not TPG, or a competitor, can obtain benefits from the transfer of the tax losses will depend on the application of the tax law to specific circumstances.<br/>
         <br/>
Ever since the Myer controversy, private equity has striven to become more transparent and engage with regulators ahead of a large transaction.<br/>
         <br/>
Yasser El-Ansary, head of the Australian Private Equity &amp; Venture Capital Association, previously said the Myer debate had left a positive legacy since the sector "is now a lot more visible".<br/>
         <br/>
But many argue Myer's abysmal share price performance post the float, along with the ensuing high-profile tax tussle, tarnished the buyout industry's reputation and closed the IPO market for almost 18 months.<br/>
         <br/>
After the 2009 listing, TPG's Australian head, Ben Gray, relocated to Singapore, returning earlier this year to Melbourne. One industry source pointed out the ATO did not have a legal case against TPG, and the ultimate test of the market's reaction was delivered last month with the successful float of Healthscope.<br/>
         <br/>
TPG has not confirmed it is looking at Treasury and declined to comment on the tax issues surrounding this potential deal and the Myer float.<br/>
         <br/>
Allan Blaikie, at the law firm Clayton Utz, questions how much the tax losses represent an incentive. He said the benefits could roughly translate into $600 million depending on whether the bidders meet a change of control test and, failing that, a same business test.<br/>
         <br/>

              <div class="document-view__body">Am I the only person utterly dumbfounded by the fact that private equity sharks Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Rhone Capital – the two suitors circling Treasury Wine Estates – have engaged former beverage and bottle purveyor Terry Davis as an adviser?<br/>
         <br/>Davis left a few problems on the Desk Of The CEO when earlier this year he handed over at Coca-Cola Amatil to former GrainCorp chief Alison Watkins. She's got to figure out what to do with a half-baked beer play, her massive (and massively cheesed off) supermarket customers and a ridiculously rampant syrup supplier (and major shareholder), The Coca-Cola Company in Atlanta – who under Davis had a 13-year run of the pen.<br/>
         <br/>
But that's just the amuse-bouche! Let us not forget that TWE's existential crisis is rooted in the $1.5 billion decision in August 2000 (by its former self, Foster's, now divided between Treasury and the beer arm owned by SABMiller) to buy American wine business, Beringer. Last year, TWE chief David Dearie copped a bullet for disastrous inventory management in its US (read: Beringer) division.<br/>
         <br/>
Well, knock me down with a feather – when Foster's bought into American plonk, Davis was boss of Foster's wine division! Here's what he said to the ASX at the time: "This combination of two great wine companies creates the world's first truly global premium wine company, and [Foster's owned] Mildara Blass and Beringer Wine Estates are pleased to be first movers in this regard."<br/>
         <br/>
A year later he was pumping up the tyres on his shiny new asset: "When you're looking at a family-owned company sometimes you don't know what you're buying… that's why we're so keen on keeping Wolf Blass involved with our business, especially with overseas customers. Beringer has been run as a corporate business since 1982 … so they've had several years to get their systems and procedures in place."<br/>
         <br/>
Funny then that Blass himself told this newspaper on Wednesday that the Beringer acquisition had been "a nightmare from day one".<br/>
         <br/>
Terry Davis, take a bow! Or maybe pass him a stiff drink?<br/>
         <br/>
Now Dearie's successor, Michael Clarke, is boganising one of Australia's most valuable brands, Penfolds (and co-conspirator Vintec), in a desperate effort to move stock and fatten his drunken cow for a market day that, God forbid, yet again, may not even come.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Ross Wilson, the ex-boss of Southcorp who in the 1990s bought Treasury Wine Estates' most important brands from the Adsteam wreckage including Penfolds, believes the US private equity firms gunning for control of the winemaker could be just what the local industry needs to repair withering brands and improve pricing.<br/>
         <br/>But that doesn't mean Mr Wilson won't be saddened about Treasury Wine falling into foreign hands.<br/>
         <br/>
''It would be sad to see an iconic Australian brand going overseas, and I think Treasury has the best wine portfolio in the world, wonderful brands, and it would be a jolly shame to see that disappear overseas,'' he said.<br/>
         <br/>
''It would be disappointing to see a fantastic company like that be taken out by private equity. But presumably it will come back on the market in two years' time as a listed entity, so maybe there will be a chance for people to get back into it again.''<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Wilson, who is also a former chief executive of wagering group Tabcorp and now runs his own winery in Victoria's Yarra Valley with his wife, said the only way the consortiums that have lobbed billion-dollar bids for Treasury Wine can make their money back would be by investing heavily in the brand equity of key wines, particularly Penfolds and Lindemans. And he reckons the whole sector would benefit from that.<br/>
         <br/>
''They [private equity] obviously see value in regenerating the value, in particular those two brands," Mr Wilson said, speaking from a yacht in the Whitsundays. "Now how do they do it? Goodness knows right now, but I think if they do do it it's good for the Australian wine industry, because we get some strength back into the top end of the wine industry.<br/>
         <br/>
''And I hope that strength, which is basically in pricing, will flow through the rest of the Australian wine industry.''Private equity battle<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury Wine has allowed Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and its partner, Rhone Capital, to conduct due diligence on the business. It will release its full-year result to the market on August 21.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury boss Mike Clarke has moved quickly since his appointment in February to shed costs at the winemaker and invest in leading brands like Penfolds.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Former Coca-Cola Amatil chief executive Terry Davis has joined forces with private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in its $3.4 billion tilt for Treasury Wine Estates, the owner of Penfolds, Rosemount and Wolf Blass.<br/>
         <br/>Mr Davis is understood to be part of the KKR and Rhone Capital buyout bid now, after initially being sounded out for his expertise by rival private equity firm Carlyle Group earlier in the ­process.<br/>
         <br/>
Carlyle has yet to declare its hand but is understood to be working on a potential buyout offer of its own, and may soon become the third bidder to enter the field of prospective buyers for Treasury.<br/>
         <br/>
The involvement of Mr Davis behind the scenes with the KKR/Rhone Capital buyout bid has been mentioned in high-level financing briefings by Macquarie, which may be involved in the financing of the KKR/Rhone offer, sources said.<br/>
         <br/>
KKR and Rhone have their financing package all but signed up subject to satisfactory due diligence, with firms including Credit Suisse, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Nomura all part of the syndicate.<br/>
         <br/>
KKR and Rhone are structuring the deal with a lower-than usual debt component for a private equity deal with debt of around $1.4 billion and equity of $2 billion.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Davis ended a 13-year stint at the helm of soft drinks maker Coca-Cola Amatil earlier this year.<br/>
         <br/>
His name was mentioned in market speculation as a potential chief executive of Treasury in late 2013, when Treasury embarked on a global search for a new boss after the board axed former chief executive David Dearie.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Dearie was sacked after an embarrassing write-down of $160 million in mid-2013 mainly related to the troubled United States business.<br/>
         <br/>
The job of chief executive of Treasury ultimately went to former British food industry executive Mike Clarke, who started on March 31 and has quickly formulated plans to try to revive Treasury's fortunes.<br/>
         <br/>
They centre on stepping up investment in the marketing behind high-end brands like Penfolds and Wynns and stripping out back-office costs.<br/>
         <br/>
Also on Tuesday, Wolf Blass, the man behind one of Treasury's most successful international brands, said whoever ends up buying the company needs to quickly sell off the ailing US operations because it has been a "nightmare from day one''.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Blass, who is still part of the Treasury stable as an "ambassador'' for the Wolf Blass brand, said he has been telling the board for years it needed to sell the US business because it was such a drain on return on investment, but it refused to listen.<br/>
         <br/>
"America has been a nightmare from day one,'' Mr Blass said.<br/>
         <br/>
He also said if either private equity bidder, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, or TPG Capital, gains control of Treasury, they should do likewise and offload the US business.<br/>
         <br/>
But he warns that any move by new private equity owners to make short-term decisions with the broader ­Treasury business would have a ­harmful impact on the entire Australian wine industry.<br/>
         <br/>
"That could be harmful if they're in it for a fast buck,'' he said.<br/>
         <br/>
TPG Capital emerged as a second bidder for Treasury on Monday with a proposal pitched at $5.20 a share, valuing the company at $3.4 billion.<br/>
         <br/>
This was the same as a buyout ­proposal lodged by KKR/Rhone a week earlier.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Blass is a pioneer of the Austra­lian wine industry and listed his eponymous company on the stock exchange in the early 1980s before it merged with another company to form Mildara Blass.<br/>
         <br/>
Mildara Blass was then bought out by beer company Foster's Group in 1996 in its first entry into the wine industry.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Blass is 79 and said he is "firing on all cylinders". He travels regularly for Treasury to promote the Wolf Blass brand, which generates 70 per cent of its sales overseas.<br/>
         <br/>
He said the strategy by new Treasury chief executive Mike Clarke to trim the brand portfolio from the current 83 brands is smart, because it is too many for all the brands to thrive.<br/>
         <br/>
"It's a lunatic situation,'' Mr Blass said.<br/>
         <br/>
But he is concerned that the work under way to trim the portfolio might be disrupted by the due diligence process as the US predators scrutinise the inner workings of the company.<br/>
         <br/>
"It is interrupting how to split them up and where to go from here,'' he said.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Blass said he cautioned the ­Foster's board against buying Beringer in the United States for $2.9 billion in 2000.<br/>
         <br/>
"This is going to be the greatest disaster you've ever made,'' Mr Blass warned them.<br/>
         <br/>
He said he doesn't own any Treasury shares, and the biggest mistake that Foster's and Treasury have made in the United States is not having strong ­Australian management running that business.<br/>
         <br/>
He has high regard for the abilities of Mr Davis, and the private equity bidders will benefit from his expertise.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Davis was managing director of Foster's wine operations when it bought Beringer in California in 2000.<br/>
         <br/>
The purchase has since proven to be a major reason for Treasury's fall from grace.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">John Spalvins, one of Australia's best-known corporate raiders from the 1980s, whose company once owned the famous Penfolds wine brand for 10 years, has launched a blistering attack against the management of Treasury Wine Estates, and Foster's Group before it. Mr Spalvins blamed poor management of Penfolds and its stablemates over the past decade and boards of directors who, he says, "did not adequately understand the wine industry" for the situation where Penfolds appears likely to fall into foreign hands.<br/>
         <br/>"From Australia's point of view it is regrettable to see ownership of major industries pass to foreign hands, particularly an icon such as Penfolds."<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Spalvins said Penfolds had a higher market share in Australia in the 1980s when it was under the control of his once-mighty Adelaide Steamship Co than it does now. United States private equity firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and junior partner Rhone Capital made an increased buyout bid for Treasury a week ago, valuing the company at $3.4 billion. Mr Spalvins said Penfolds' market share had diminished in Australia for one reason: "The short answer is management."<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Spalvins's strident views about Australian's wine industry, and in particular the management of Penfolds, will no doubt draw criticism themselves because of the way in Mr Spalvins's own company collapsed in 1991 under debt levels of $7 billion. Out of the ashes of Adelaide Steamship, which at the time included Woolworths, David Jones and a string of large food brands, some of Australia's strongest businesses have emerged. Woolworths has grown into a supermarket giant with a market capitalisation of $45 billion.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Spalvins was also scathing about the attempts by Foster's Group to manage such a large stable of wine brands prior to Treasury splitting off as a stand-alone wine company in mid-2011.<br/>
         <br/>
Having Penfolds sitting alongside a string of other big wine brands such as Rosemount, Lindemans, Wolf Blass, Seppelt and Saltram made it very difficult, and there was an "inability to manage a large number of brands".Expensive and disastrous<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Spalvins said the 2000 acquisition of Beringer Wine Estates in California was expensive and disastrous.<br/>
         <br/>
He said both Foster's and Treasury appeared to have boards of directors "who did not adequately understand the wine industry". It was a tough business in which to make profits consistently because of the cyclical factors involved in an agricultural industry, but adequate returns would come from well-managed businesses.<br/>
         <br/>
"Without a doubt the industry has a large cyclical factor and investment of capital must be carefully monitored, but adequate returns can be earned if marketing and promotion of brands is correctly handled and capital not wasted," he said.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Spalvins, who does not own any Treasury shares, said there were many examples of premium wine companies in the United States delivering solid returns. He said Treasury, because of its size, had the advantage of large-scale production and marketing, but had failed to earn adequate returns.<br/>
         <br/>
KKR and Rhone have offered $5.20 a share for Treasury, up from a $4.70-a-share proposal made by KKR alone in mid-April. "Purely from a financial point of view the shareholders should accept; the track record of current management does not justify a higher price," Mr Spalvins said.<br/>
         <br/>
He was speaking from the United States, where he is travelling. He is 78 and lives in the affluent Adelaide suburb of Springfield, and said he still gains pleasure seeing the high-end Penfolds wines on wine lists around the globe.<br/>
         <br/>
He said interest rates of 18 per cent and higher in the late 1980s that brought the highly leveraged Adelaide Steamship empire down were ultimately too hard to manage. Australia's big conglomerates now, such as Wesfarmers, were doing a fine job, but it was easier to manage debt levels with current interest rates of 5 per cent or so.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Spalvins said he does look back with frustration at the strong businesses inside Adelaide Steamship that have gone on to be valued very highly by the sharemarket, and the inability of the company to hold them all together.<br/>
         <br/>
"Yes, it is frustrating to think of what could have been," he said.<br/>
         <br/>
Adelaide Steamship took ownership of Penfolds in 1980 when it bought the broader brewing business of Tooth &amp; Co, but sold it to SA Brewing in 1990 as part of a drawn asset-sale program forced on it by bankers.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Equity It may be time for the winemaker to free itself from the pressures of the sharemarket.<br/>
         <br/>The Australian executive who once ran the world's biggest wine business has clear views on the best prospects for the resurrection of Penfolds owner ­Treasury Wine Estates: shareholders should take the money and run.<br/>
         <br/>
Stephen Millar, who ran the global wine operations of Constellation Brands for three years until 2006, says being a public company isn't the right place for Treasury in its current state.<br/>
         <br/>
He says it should hand over the keys to the United States private equity firms led by KKR &amp; Co, who've made an enhanced $3.4 billion ­takeover bid and let them fix it up, away from the ­spotlight of being listed on the Australian Securities Exchange. "There is no doubt that if a business needs strategic changes, resurrecting, and has some challenges, then it is harder because you're needing to ­satisfy the institutional investors all the time," he says.<br/>
         <br/>
That is the same argument KKR and its junior partner Rhone Capital are mounting. They are trying to convince the Treasury board to hand over ­ownership of the business, which owns 83 wine brands led by Penfolds, ­Rosemount, Wolf Blass, Lindemans, Saltram and Wynns. KKR and Rhone have offered $5.20 a share for Treasury, up from KKR's initial solo proposal of mid-April of $4.70 a share.<br/>
         <br/>
Millar emphasises he owns no Treasury shares himself and has no axe to grind, despite having been a fierce competitors to Penfolds and its­ ­stablemates for more than a decade when he ran BRL Hardy until 2003. BRL Hardy's brands including Hardys, Leasingham, Houghton and Brookland Valley are now owned by another private equity firm, CHAMP, and the company is now known as Accolade Wines. Constellation still holds 20 per cent, but itself had a rough time after the buy out in delivering good returns as the Australian dollar rose sharply, making it hard for wine exports from Australia.State of business<br/>
         <br/>
Timing is everything. BRL Hardy was the poster child of the Australian wine industry in its halcyon days, with Mr Millar taking it from a $100 million company in 1992 to a $1.9 billion buyout bonanza for shareholders in 2003.<br/>
         <br/>
"The timing was right," he says.<br/>
         <br/>
He says BRL Hardy needed capital to grow and public funding was the best source at the time. But Treasury is in a far different position, having been through a string of owners with different strategies who've been trying to use its size and clout to make headway.<br/>
         <br/>
KKR and Rhone, who has a ­co-founder in Robert Agostinelli, who once tried to buy out the Liverpool ­Football Club in England's Premier League soccer competition in 2010, want to overhaul the Treasury business and argue it will be best done without ­having to deliver half-year and full-year profit expectations without a slip-up.<br/>
         <br/>
"A lot depends on the state of the business," Millar says.<br/>
         <br/>
There were 20 ASX-listed wine ­companies and wine investment funds in the late 1990s and early 2000s but the public company funding model is now largely out of favour in the industry, with few remaining.<br/>
         <br/>
Investments take a long time to bring payback because of the long lead times in an agricultural industry. Under ­private ownership "you will get time for that to pay off", Millar says.<br/>
         <br/>
KKR and Rhone will be paying ­special attention to the US operations of Treasury over the next few weeks as they undertake due diligence on the inner workings of the business.<br/>
         <br/>
It is the US where Treasury and its previous owner, Foster's Group, have blown $2 billion of shareholders funds over more than a decade.<br/>
         <br/>
Foster's bought the Beringer wine business for $2.9 billion in 2000 in a grand ­expansion plan, but analysts now believe the US operations are worth only about $1 billion.Management is key<br/>
         <br/>
KKR and Rhone and their advisers will be having long chats with the likes of Southern Wine and Spirits, the ­largest wine and spirits distributor in the US which operates in 35 States. The Miami-based group was one of those left with mountains of cheap bottled wine from Treasury's US wineries in its ­warehouses when Treasury miscalculated its supply and demand. It led to the ­infamous decision in mid-2013 by Treasury to destroy 6 million bottles of wine from warehouses across the country to rid itself of the excess supply.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury was split off from Foster's as a stand-alone wine company in May, 2011 and on its first day of trading on the ASX its share price was $3.45. It had fluctuated, but by May, 2013 it had soared to $6.47. It had always been earmarked as a takeover target but a series of mishaps in the US mainly, caused the share price to plunge and opened the door for offshore raiders such as KKR.<br/>
         <br/>
Millar says it is important for any new owner to get the strategy right, and being owned by offshore companies won't be an issue.<br/>
         <br/>
"It really doesn't matter whether the owners are American, English or French, it's the quality of the management and getting those strategic decisions right. Management is the key".</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Liquor retailers say the prospect of Treasury Wine Estates' portfolio of 80-plus brands being owned by an ­overseas company is unlikely to produce a customer backlash, unless price rises are pursued by new private equity owners.<br/>
         <br/>Dean Taylor, the chief executive of Cracka Wines, one of Australia's biggest online wine retailers, said on Wednesday the portfolio of brands owned by Treasury including Penfolds, Rosemounts, Wynns, Saltram and Wolf Blass, had been through so many ownership changes in the past two decades that another one won't change customer perceptions.<br/>
         <br/>
But what customers would be closely monitoring would be any attempt to lift prices, or change the quality. "That would upset them,'' Mr Taylor said. "There is an element of our customer base who would care about foreign ownership but for most people it would be any change in quality or price that is the major factor.''<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Taylor said while the Treasury brands had a large presence in the Australian market, there was little evidence that customers were truly passionate about most of them.<br/>
         <br/>
"There's aren't a lot of customers that are brand advocates,'' he said.<br/>
         <br/>
United States private equity firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and junior partner Rhone Capital made a higher buyout proposal for Treasury on ­Monday pitched at $5.20 a share, which valued the company at $3.4 billion. This was 50¢ higher than a solo ­proposal made by KKR in mid-April at $4.70 a share.<br/>
         <br/>
The Treasury board has agreed to let the duo in to undertake due diligence on a "non-exclusive'' basis, which leaves the door open for any rival bidders.<br/>
         <br/>
One of the brands which new Treasury chief executive Mike Clarke is trying to super-charge by putting much more marketing spending behind it is the Wynns brand from the Coonawarra district in south-east South Australia.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Taylor said he agreed with the attempt to lift Wynns higher, but pointed to a period in the early 2000s after a merger between former owner Southcorp and the Rosemount company that was then owned by the Oatley family, when Wynns was heavily discounted and the brand damaged.<br/>
         <br/>
"Wynns probably deserves to sit a lot higher in the hierarchy,'' he said.Customers indifferent<br/>
         <br/>
David Reberger, the general manager of Kemenys, which runs a substantial online business along with a large retail outlet in Bondi, said he didn't think customers would be too concerned about famous wine brands like Penfolds being owned by US-based private equity firms.<br/>
         <br/>
"I believe that customers are indifferent,'' he said.<br/>
         <br/>
They tend to follow individual brands and aren't generally perturbed about the ultimate owner of the company, he said.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Reberger said Treasury and its previous incarnation, the wine division of Foster's Group, had pushed too hard in driving up the price of the Wynns portfolio over the past five years or so.<br/>
         <br/>
"There's only so far you can push it in Australia," he said.<br/>
         <br/>
But he said the Wynns brand does have much more potential in offshore markets, and perhaps hadn't been marketed as well as it could have been.<br/>
         <br/>
"I think that's a brand that's got a lot more potential,'' he said.<br/>
         <br/>
Cameron Kidd, the owner of Rathdowne Cellars in North Carlton in Melbourne, said company ownership was largely irrelevant in the purchasing decision by a buyer, with quality and value at the forefront. He believed a change in ownership wouldn't filter down to the average wine buyer.<br/>
         <br/>
"I would say that most of our customers don't care which company owns a brand,'' he said.<br/>
         <br/>
But there were exceptions. There had been a major backlash against the Tamar Ridge brand in the late 2000s when it was still owned by timber company Gunns, which was in the spotlight over environmental issues in Tasmania related to a proposed pulp mill.<br/>
         <br/>
"There was a huge backlash,'' Mr Kidd said.<br/>
         <br/>
Tamar Ridge was sold by Gunns in 2010 to Victorian company Brown Brothers.<br/>
         <br/>
United States drinks giant Constellation Brands, which still owns 20 per cent of Accolade Wines, the local firm which owns brands such as Hardys and Leasingham, is considered unlikely to mount a rival bid for Treasury.<br/>
         <br/>
Constellation's vice-president of communications, Cheryl Gossin, said from New York the company "does not comment on rumour or speculation''.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Shanghai | Treasury Wine Estates' ­top-selling Penfolds brand has been removed from all InterContinental Hotels in China, amid fears those selling the wine could be liable for damages in a long-running trademark dispute.<br/>
         <br/>The removal is a blow to the takeover target's China strategy and raises fears other large hotel chains, supermarkets and online stores may follow in ­suspending sales of Australia's best known wine.<br/>
         <br/>
InterContinental, which has 214 hotels across China, removed ­Penfolds from its wine lists last week citing legal advice.<br/>
         <br/>
"I would ask you to pull your ­Penfolds branded wines off your menus until further notice," Tim ­Stanhope, the director of food and ­beverage operations, said in an email to managers on July 28. "We don't want to be involved in any further law actions."<br/>
         <br/>
The Australian Financial Review reported on July 13 that Penfolds had failed to register its Chinese name and was now locked in a legal battle with a notorious trademark squatter to reclaim it. Penfolds said it had won an initial court case against the man, but the ruling was being appealed and the matter ongoing.<br/>
         <br/>
Penfolds is up against the same squatter who won a record 33.73 million yuan ($5.8 million) from French wine giant Castel, after he ­registered its Chinese name.<br/>
         <br/>
In a phone conversation, Mr ­Stanhope confirmed InterContinental had stopped selling Penfolds wine and said the company was being cautious.<br/>
         <br/>
An industry source estimated the InterContinental contract could be worth around 5000 cases annually to Penfolds or around 5 per cent of its total shipments to China.<br/>
         <br/>
"Do you want to take the risk of being sued or do you just find another brand to sell? Lets be frank, there are plenty of other brands," said the wine ­industry source.<br/>
         <br/>
The InterContinental decision comes amid a deteriorating business environment for foreign companies in China, who are increasingly being ­targeted by regulators and the state controlled media.<br/>
         <br/>
In recent months, United States tech firms Microsoft and Qualcomm have come under investigation for ­anti-competitive behaviour, while Apple and Starbucks have been singled out for heavy criticism in the media.<br/>
         <br/>
In this environment, many foreign ­business are being overly cautious.<br/>
         <br/>
In his email, Mr Stanhope said under Chinese law outlets which sold goods found to have infringed a trademark were also considered to be have broken the law. "Therefore in order to play it safe, it's better that hotels stop selling the wine until there is a court ­judgement announced," the email said.<br/>
         <br/>
This could be months if not years away as Treasury began legal action to reclaim its Chinese name, Ben Fu, in 2011.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury representatives were not available for comment.<br/>
         <br/>
A search of China's trademarks office found three variations of ­Penfolds' Chinese name, which loosely translates to "chasing prosperity", have been registered. The last of these was approved in December 2013, more than two years after Treasury began legal action to reclaim the name.<br/>
         <br/>
The trademarks are held by Li Shen and Li Daozhi, both from the coastal city of Wenzhou and are thought to be related. Li Daozhi won the record­ ­trademark claim against Castel in August last year after registering the French giants Chinese name, Kasite.<br/>
         <br/>
He now markets his own wine under the Kasite brand in China in direct ­competition to the French wine maker.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">United States private equity firms ­Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Rhone Capital have a debt package worth about $1.4 billion all but finalised for the proposed $3.4 billion buyout of ­Treasury Wine Estates. They will run the company with lower gearing than in normal private equity investments.<br/>
         <br/>The two firms also have teams primed to spend most of their due ­diligence period on the troublesome United States operations of Treasury because they regard this business as the biggest potential swing factor in ­formulating a final, binding proposal.<br/>
         <br/>
KKR and Rhone are thought to have signed agreements with several firms for the debt package, including Credit Suisse, Nomura and Bank of America Merrill Lynch. They are all predicated on satisfactory due diligence. KKR and Rhone plan to use a ­conservative ­gearing ratio compared with traditional private equity ­investments because wine is an agricultural ­industry subject to seasonal ­conditions and fluctuating earnings.<br/>
         <br/>
The debt component is thought to be about 40 per cent. The introduction of New York-based Rhone Capital into the bidding vehicle with an intended 15 to 20 per cent Treasury stake if the offer is successful, has reduced the level of equity required by KKR, but combined, it will be about $2 billion.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury, which owns brands including Penfolds, Wolf Blass, ­Rosemount, Lindemans, and Saltram, got a higher buyout offer from KKR and Rhone on Monday, pitched at $5.20 a share. It was 50¢ higher than a previous offer from KKR in mid-April of $4.70.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury shares jumped more than 4 per cent on Monday after the higher bid was revealed and gained a further 2¢ on Tuesday to close at $5.17.<br/>
         <br/>
Advisers and lawyers for both sides are close to finalising a confidential agreement to allow KKR and Rhone to begin due diligence. They are likely to get access to the inner workings of the company later this week.<br/>
         <br/>
The Beringer Vineyards operations in California and the broader United States operations are a major focus for KKR and Rhone, given the major ­blunders at Treasury have been in the US, including the infamous ­mis-reading of the market in 2013 which resulted in overflowing stock ­levels in ­third-party US distributor warehouses of cheaper commercial wine. This resulted in the destruction of 6 million bottles of wine.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury chief executive Mike Clarke was in his Melbourne head office on Tuesday working on his own strategic plans. China's Bright Foods has ruled itself out as a Treasury buyer. US drinks giant Constellation Brands is an unlikely rival bidder after chief ­executive Robert Sands signalled in July when the company released its quarterly results, that the focus was on paying debt and not large acquisitions.<br/>
         <br/>
It comes as debate rages about the potential impact of a change in ­ownership of some of Australia's most prestigious wine brands to private equity firms. The private equity model ­generally revolves around owning a business for between five to seven years, before it is sold again in either a public float or a trade sale.<br/>
         <br/>
Mitchell Taylor, the chairman of Australia's First Families of Wines, an umbrella body of 12 family-owned wine companies with long histories, said the wine industry needed long-term ­planning and decisions that may not pay off for a decade.<br/>
         <br/>
"In the wine game I don't think it's good for the industry if there's that short-term quick-buck, in-and-out mentality. You do need that patient capital," he said.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Taylor is managing director of Taylors Wines, based in Clare Valley, South Australia. It belongs to Australia's First Families of Wine which also include companies such as Brown Brothers, Henschke, Yalumba and ­Tyrrell's Wines. He said the family-owned groups would invest in the business, knowing the benefit may not flow fully until the next generation took over.<br/>
         <br/>
"We're looking at generational investments and decisions."</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">The Australian food businesses owned by Chinese company Bright Food Group are set to form a large part of its initial public offering on the Hong Kong stock exchange, but the company has ruled out making a rival bid for ­Treasury Wine Estates to expand the operations further.<br/>
         <br/>The Australian operations, which include Manassen Foods, fruit exporter Mildura Fruit Company, and Western Australia cheese and yoghurt maker Mundella, are a central part of a future public listing in Hong Kong, with the group having already tested the ­appetite of potential IPO investors.<br/>
         <br/>
But the timing of a float of the ­Asia-Pacific food assets is still being decided and the group wants to grow to more than twice its current size before hitting the button on an IPO intended to fund even more acquisitions.<br/>
         <br/>
Trying to snap up Treasury Wine Estates, the owner of the Penfolds brand, is not on the radar.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury on Monday received an enhanced $3.4 billion buyout offer from private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and its junior partner Rhone Capital.<br/>
         <br/>
Bright Food Group Holdings chief financial officer and director Wayne McIntosh said on Tuesday that while Bright Food had looked from afar at Treasury in the past, it was not ­interested in joining a bidding war.<br/>
         <br/>
"We're not actively interested in Treasury,'' he said from his ­Sydney office.<br/>
         <br/>
"Everything we do in Australia comes through this office and we're ­certainly not engaged in that."<br/>
         <br/>
The main priority for Bright Food as it heads towards a Hong Kong float of the Asia-Pacific food operations is buying premium food service businesses in Singapore, Hong Kong and China and to acquire more fast-moving consumer goods distribution operations in China, from which it can sell more of the sought-after food products being made by its Australian businesses.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr McIntosh said Bright Food Group Holdings had net annual ­revenue of a little more than ­$600 million and wanted to head towards $1.5 billion.<br/>
         <br/>
"Where we are now, we're probably only around half way,'' he said.<br/>
         <br/>
The company had considered listing on the Australian Securities Exchange, but the Hong Kong plan was a better strategic option.<br/>
         <br/>
The Australian and New Zealand operations of Bright Food would form a large part of the business that would be listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange, and this had been recognised by potential investors in Asia.<br/>
         <br/>
Those businesses were performing solidly in a tough food market. Bright Foods has undertaken pre-IPO roadshows in Singapore and Hong Kong to test the appetite from investors. ­Manassen's Australian retail ­operations had over-delivered against budget by around $3 million in ­earnings before interest, tax and ­amortisation in calendar 2013.<br/>
         <br/>
"The local operations are performing well in a challenging market,'' Mr McIntosh said.<br/>
         <br/>
The business had been able to ­implement price increases in the ­second half of calendar 2013 which were able to mitigate the impact of the high Australian dollar.<br/>
         <br/>
The company will also look for other acquisitions where it is able to derive synergies with its existing portfolio of businesses, and has set a target of 10 per cent incremental EBITDA for any ­purchases it makes.<br/>
         <br/>
Bright Food purchased Mundella for an undisclosed price in January, a few months before the group pulled off one its biggest deals, scooping up 56 per cent of Israeli food giant Tnuva in a deal worth more than $1 billion.<br/>
         <br/>
The group is also the owner of a 60 per cent stake in British cereal maker ­Weetabix, which is bought in May 2012 in a £1.2 billion deal.<br/>
         <br/>
Manassen, which Bright Food bought 75 per cent of in 2011 for around $30 million, has a range of bakery, ­grocery, biscuit and confectionery brands in its food portfolio including Holland House, Ryvita, Coffex coffee, Tilda and Trident. The Mildura Fruit Company, is one of Australia's largest exporters of citrus fruits and sources its produce from around 150 growers in the Sunraysia region.<br/>
         <br/>
Bright also struck a $40 million deal three months ago with Pactum Dairy Group, owned by Freedom Foods, for the supply of long-life dairy milk.<br/>
         <br/>
The Chinese giant's reach also extends across the Tasman through its majority ownership of Synlait Milk, which listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange last year.<br/>
         <br/>
Last month, Bright Food said it was prepared to spend as much as $2 billion on acquisitions in China and around the world.<br/>
         <br/>
But chairman Lv Yongjie said the company was not interested in deals that were "too small".</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">There is a good chance Australia's most prominent wine brand, Penfolds, will be in foreign hands by year end. Treasury Wine Estates has granted Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) access to its books after rebuffing the private equity giant's initial offer in April.<br/>
         <br/>TWE's board is still not wild about the prospect of a takeover bid but at $5.20 per share it had little choice but to engage. The tone of TWE's statement to the market on Monday says a lot. The company spends three paragraphs reiterating the current strategy under chief executive Michael Clarke to breathe life back into the company by ramping up marketing, improving costs and building its iconic Penfolds brand.<br/>
         <br/>
While Clarke's strategy has been received favourably in some quarters, KKR does not necessarily share their enthusiasm. While moving without waiting to see the company's full-year results later this month gives it first-mover advantage, another theory is that KKR wanted to get in early and head off any potential damage from the change in strategy.<br/>
         <br/>
Clarke has made some big changes, including moving the release dates for Penfolds wines. A discounted $650 wine fridge with every six bottles of Penfolds wine has also been the centrepiece of a marketing blitz to boost sales which should enable the company to meet forecasts.<br/>
         <br/>
The assumption is the company has avoided another earnings downgrade for now, or else it would have been obligated to announce something on Monday. But KKR has its own ideas about how to fix the company in the longer term and that will involve bringing in its own internal consultants to stress test the business and inject more capital where required.<br/>
         <br/>
KKR and partner Rhone Capital have upped their initial offer by 10.6 per cent and it is now a 40.9 per cent premium to where TWE was trading before the first approach was made in April. A non-exclusive clause means TWE has not closed the door on rival bidders coming in at a higher price, although there are no signs so far of a white knight. The $5.20 a share offer is also more in line with higher multiples being paid for wine assets due to their strategic value. The median of the past 24 wine transactions is 13.2 times trailing EBITDA, which is a fraction below the $5.20 per share, according to analysts.<br/>
         <br/>
TWE has been a consistent target of takeover speculation since it was spun out of Foster's in 2011 but there is a sense of inevitability it will be taken out this time round. The question then is will KKR break-up the company? Spinning off Penfolds, the jewel in the crown, would make sense as that is where most of the company's value lies. There would be no shortage of TWE's US operations either.<br/>
         <br/>
But it is understood the current interest is in TWE's entire portfolio and there are no plans to break up the company. KKR's track record shows it would also seek to drive more value out of the Penfolds brand before looking to hive anything off. KKR will be hoping for a repeat of the returns it made on South Korea's Oriental Brewery, which it acquired in 2009 with partner Affinity Equity.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">A negative mood in global equity ­markets saw Australian shares post a modest fall, despite the release of some better than expected retail sales data.<br/>
         <br/>The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX 200 Index and the broader All Ordinaries Index each fell 0.3 per cent on Monday to 5540.9 points and 5533.3 points ­respectively. While the market overall was weak, merger and acquisition activity gave some stocks, notably Treasury Wine Estates, a boost.<br/>
         <br/>
Local shares fell as much as 0.5 per cent in early trade after the United States' S&amp;P 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average declined, despite the release of a solid jobs report on ­Friday night.<br/>
         <br/>
"Australian shares trended lower as investors reacted to further falls in US and European bourses on Friday. ­Volumes were on the light side, affected by Monday's NSW bank holiday," Patersons Securities chief investment strategist Tony Farnham said.<br/>
         <br/>
Asian markets provided mixed cues in the afternoon session. When the ASX closed Hong Kong's Hang Seng and China's Shanghai Composite Index were both stronger while Japan's Nikkei had slipped.<br/>
         <br/>
China's official non-manufacturing purchasing managers index on Sunday fell to a six-month low of 54.2 points in July, dragged down by a weaker property market.<br/>
         <br/>
In local economic news, Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed retail sales rose 0.6 per cent, seasonally adjusted, in June. The result reversed two months of declining sales amid weak consumer sentiment in the wake of the federal budget announcement and an unseasonably warm start to winter.Job advertisements rise<br/>
         <br/>
A survey by ANZ Bank showed total job advertisements rose 0.3 per cent in July. That followed June's 4.4 per cent increase and left ads up 4.2 per cent on July last year.<br/>
         <br/>
A private inflation gauge indicated price pressures are subsiding. The TD Securities-Melbourne Institute's monthly consumer price index edged up just 0.2 per cent in July against ­seasonal expectations for a much stronger rise.<br/>
         <br/>
The better than expected retail sales data helped the biggest food and liquor sellers outperform the market. Woolworths and Wesfarmers, owner of Coles, each edged up 0.1 per cent to $36.49 and $43.35 respectively.<br/>
         <br/>
Declines in the big four banks pulled the index lower. Commonwealth Bank of Australia shed 0.3 per cent to $82.58, while Westpac Banking Corporation dropped 0.6 per cent to $33.85. ANZ Banking Group lost 0.7 per cent to $33.34, and National Australia Bank fell 0.5 per cent to $34.77.<br/>
         <br/>
Telecommunications giant Telstra Corporation shed 0.2 per cent to $5.43.<br/>
         <br/>
Resources giant BHP Billiton was also a drag, down 0.3 per cent to $38.30.<br/>
         <br/>
Main rival Rio Tinto edged up 0.1 per cent to $65.43 despite the spot price for iron ore, landed in China, slipping 0.4 per cent to $US95.20 a tonne. When the market closed, Dalian iron ore futures trading in China was tipping a rise overnight. Junior iron ore miner Atlas Iron was the best-performing stock in the ASX 200, climbing 9.2 per cent to 71¢ after delivering an upbeat presentations to the annual Diggers and Dealers conference.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury Wine Estates, owner of the Penfolds and Lindeman's brands, jumped 4 per cent to $5.15 as US private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts bowed to pressure and lifted its buyout offer to more than $5 per share.<br/>
         <br/>
Junior explorer and producer Roc Oil added 7.1 per cent to 67.5¢ after the board recommended shareholders accept a 69¢ per share cash takeover offer from China's Fosun Group.<br/>
         <br/>
Roc's spurned suitor Horizon Oil was the worst-performing stock in the ASX 200, dropping 6.8 per cent to 34.5¢.<br/>
         <br/>
Philippines-focused explorer Nido Petroleum soared 24.4 per cent to 5¢ as Thailand's Bangchak Group made a $113 million cash takeover offer.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Traders who consider derivative strategies during the reporting season will be closely monitoring the performance of prominent shares to ensure they deliver what is expected.<br/>
         <br/>Where there is a good chance they will, says Ord Minnett senior derivatives adviser Wai-Yee Chen, this can present selected opportunities to generate extra yield through the medium of exchange-traded options.<br/>
         <br/>
One prominent share that could fit this bill, says Chen, is local retail giant Woolworths. With a better earnings expectation and a possible higher dividend when it reports its result on August 29, any investor who agrees with this outlook could consider selling an August $36.50 at the money put option for a 44¢ a share credit trade.<br/>
         <br/>
If exercised to buy the shares at any time during August, says Chen, an investor will be in line for an expected 73¢ fully franked dividend in September from shares that were bought 44¢ cheaper through the use of puts. At the same time any downside risk in this strategy can be managed by buying a $36.14 September expiry put option for an 85¢ cost as part of any overall strategy where the net of the two trades is a 41¢ per share debit.<br/>
         <br/>
This combined put spread trade, says Chen, has the scope to deliver several benefits to investors in the form of a chance of buying shares for $36.91 with the downside protected to $36.55 – which was around the current price Monday. Then there is the opportunity for an immediate 73¢ dividend, uncapped upside and a guaranteed exit price of $36.14.<br/>
         <br/>
While this week will sees BWP Trust and REA Group report, it will be much bigger next week with the Commonwealth Bank, Suncorp and ANZ reporting along with Telstra, Wesfarmers, JB Hi-Fi, Carsales.com and CSL Ltd.<br/>
         <br/>
The share action on Monday focused on defensive plays and a number of takeover stocks. CMC Markets chief strategist Michael McCarthy noted that Australian shares steadied Monday after a rocky start. The property sector gained the most as the new Scentre Group appeared to benefit from institutional re-weighting into its shares. Explorer and producer Roc Oil traded to four-year highs on news that it spurned Horizon's attempted "merger of equals" in favour of an all cash bid at 69¢ per share from China's Fosun International and Treasury Wine Estates that saw its shares surge after American private equity firm KKR lifted its takeover offer for the company that owns Penfolds, among a number of other wine brands.<br/>
         <br/>
This week, traders are likely to spend a bit of time digesting a deluge of data released on Tuesday, says IG Markets strategist Evan Lucas. This included stronger than expected retail sales, higher job advertisements and benign inflation signals which all looked fairly positive for the $A.<br/>
         <br/>
For the trading minded, gold attracted a fair share of comments from trading analysts with Matt Simpson from Thinkforex observing that it continues to whipsaw between key support and resistance levels, in many instances fooling investors into thinking a new trend is forming.<br/>
         <br/>
While this was making trading conditions problematic for those prepared to hold a strategy for longer than a day at a time, there may be a more bullish picture unfolding.<br/>
         <br/>
Since achieving its $US1345 high price, gold has declined lower, although each swing has become increasingly smaller as the price seemed to be coiling up into a potential bullish wedge pattern.<br/>
         <br/>
The problem with gold is timing the bottom of such a pattern.<br/>
         <br/>
Simpson reckons it would be safer to wait for a break above a key swing high such as $US1312 before assuming the corrective pattern has ended.<br/>
         <br/>
Another gold commentator, OANDA technical specialist Stuart McPhee, noted that while gold eased lower last week and put pressure on the $US1290 support level, it rallied to start the new week above this level. McPhee also observed that the gold position of his firm's clients was 70 per cent long showing a change to a more bullish sentiment despite the price down trend.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">The board of Treasury Wine Estates is demanding private equity suitors Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and its junior ­partner Rhone Capital accelerate their due diligence process to minimise ­disruption as the maker of Penfolds weighs an increased $3.4 billion ­takeover offer.<br/>
         <br/>KKR, which made an initial ­confidential approach to Treasury on April 16 at $4.70 per share which only became public several weeks later, has increased its offer to $5.20 per share which the Treasury board deemed high enough to start engaging in talks with KKR.<br/>
         <br/>
The Treasury board, led by chairman Paul Rayner, will let KKR and Rhone Capital inside the company to obtain further detailed information. However, that offer is on a "non-exclusive'' due diligence basis which opens the door for other potential bidders to now make their move.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury is pushing for KKR/Rhone to conduct a quick due diligence period of between four to six weeks to minimise the risk of distraction and ­destabilisation, according to sources.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury shares jumped more than 4 per cent on Monday but didn't ­manage to reach the $5.20 mark, hitting an intra-day high of $5.18, before closing at $5.15, up 20 cents for the day.<br/>
         <br/>
This indicates there is some doubt amongst investors that a final offer might be agreed.<br/>
         <br/>
It also reflects the market view that a rival bidder may not emerge.<br/>
         <br/>
KKR made its first Treasury buyout proposal in April alone and has now brought in a junior partner, fellow United States private equity firm Rhone Capital.<br/>
         <br/>
It is likely to have a stake of between 15 to 20 per cent in Treasury if the offer is successful.<br/>
         <br/>
The main asset they are after is the Penfolds brand, which makes around 75 per cent of Treasury's profits.<br/>
         <br/>
The higher bid was first revealed on afr.com on Sunday night.<br/>
         <br/>
The new offer for the maker of ­Penfolds, Wolf Blass, Lindemans, Rosemount and Wynns, continues the ­rollercoaster ride for Treasury, which has suffered a string of heavy writedowns mainly linked to its ­underperforming United States wine operations.<br/>
         <br/>
New chief executive Mike Clarke, a former food executive in the United Kingdom, started at the helm of Treasury on March 31.<br/>
         <br/>
He has outlined his own plans to revive the company including heavy investment in the top-end brands, a vigorous cost-cutting program and separating out the high-end brands such as Penfolds internally to set them apart from the mass-market brands.<br/>
         <br/>
An internal note sent by Mr Clarke to the company's 3500 staff on Monday urged them not to be distracted by the higher bid, and to get on with the job.<br/>
         <br/>
"The most important thing you can do over the coming weeks is to focus on the delivery of our FY15 plans and ensure speculation about TWE's ownership does not distract you from making, marketing and selling our fabulous wines,'' Mr Clarke said in his note to staff.<br/>
         <br/>
The Treasury board said if a binding offer eventuated, it would assess whether the KKR/Rhone offer would deliver better value to the company's 73,000 shareholders than Mr Clarke's own strategic plan.<br/>
         <br/>
Should KKR/Rhone be successful with its $5.20 per share offer, which is at a 40.9 per cent premium to the $3.69 per share price at which Treasury was trading when KKR made its first buyout proposal, it will mean the Penfolds brand will have its seventh corporate owner since 1976.<br/>
         <br/>
Jason Beddow, the managing director of Argo Investments, which has a share portfolio worth $5 billion, said on Monday his firm deliberately steers clear of investing in wine companies. "It's been a hard place to make money,'' Mr Beddow said.<br/>
         <br/>
Argo was previously an investor in Foster's Group when it had the former Treasury business in its portfolio. Treasury split off from Foster's in mid-2011 but came to grief in mid-2013 when it suffered $160 million in writedowns in the US and needed to destroy 6 million bottles of cheap bottled wine.<br/>
         <br/>
This embarrassment caused the Treasury board to axe then chief executive David Dearie.<br/>
         <br/>
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, almost 20 different wine companies and wine investment funds were listed on the ASX.<br/>
         <br/>
In the six years leading up to 2005 most disappeared through takeover, financial collapse or being wound up because of poor returns.<br/>
         <br/>
The wine industry is very capital intensive and subject to both agricultural fluctuations and changing tastes of consumers for different wine varieties.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">High-flying US billionaire out to improve his cellar<br/>
         <br/>Robert Agostinelli, one of the principals of Rhone Group, which has linked up with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts to make a higher bid for Penfolds owner Treasury Wine Estates, has always aimed high.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Agostinelli, a US billionaire who set up the Rhone ­private equity firm with Steven ­Langman in the mid-1990s, once tried to buy Liverpool Football Club in Britain when it was in financial distress in 2010.<br/>
         <br/>
The flamboyant 61-year-old moves in distinguished circles and is friends with former presidents George Bush and Nicolas Sarkozy.<br/>
         <br/>
He also has an extensive wine ­collection and has long been familiar with the global prestige of the Penfolds brand. Rhone also holds a stake in Quiksilver, the Australian ­surfwear brand headquartered in California.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Agostinelli has always had an eye for a deal and even though based in New York, he has strong connections in London, built when he worked in mergers and acquisitions for Goldman Sachs in the 1980s before ­joining Lazard. Goldman Sachs in ­Australia has been bunkered down with Treasury Wine Estates in defending it from offers.<br/>
         <br/>
KKR is still very much the driver in the increased bid for Treasury revealed on Monday morning, which values the wine group at $3.4 billion, with Rhone the junior partner. Based on the size of the respective funds, it is likely Rhone will end up with a stake of 15 to 20 per cent, with KKR's investment funds holding the bulk of Treasury. It is believed final negotiations about the make up of the respective stakes in the bidding vehicle are still being finalised.Liverpool bid<br/>
         <br/>
Rhone Capital's tilt for a 40 per cent chunk of Liverpool FC in 2010 brought Mr Agostinelli fully into the public ­spotlight in the northern hemisphere.<br/>
         <br/>
Liverpool was one of the most successful football clubs in Britain's P­remier League. It's finances were in disarray after debt levels got too high and Mr Agostinelli and his Rhone ­colleagues made a buyout offer for 40 per cent of the club.<br/>
         <br/>
After months of intrigue and counter proposals, Liverpool directors put the club up for sale. It was bought by Fenway Sports Group. Liverpool FC is among the world's biggest sporting clubs brands, say global experts such as US business publication Forbes, but it sits below fellow UK Premier League club Manchester United, and Spanish club Real Madrid in the value stakes.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Langman also once worked at Lazard before he and Mr Agostinelli established Rhone.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Agostinelli has also been in the spotlight in Britain's papers over a court battle with his former fiancee, ­Charlotte Lucas, as he used legal avenues to demand the return of an expensive engagement ring he bought her in 2007. The legal battle hit the headlines earlier this year after their six-year ­relationship ended.<br/>
         <br/>
A successful takeover of Treasury in conjunction with KKR would mark the first direct investment in Australia by Rhone, although it owns companies with headquarters in overseas ­countries that have local operations in Australia, such as Quiksilver.<br/>
         <br/>
It has also just sold out of an investment in the global cosmetics, perfume and beauty products company Coty.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Here inside the beltway of Sydney's inner east (where, if you don't reside "you're just camping out"), June marked the opening of the eighth commercial wonder of the world: Double Bay's new shopping village, in which supermarket giant Woolworths has opened a new store, alongside its subsidiary stores About Life (for pilates mums) and Dan Murphy's (for newspaper columnists).<br/>
         <br/>Having spent so many of their best years gazing blankly into rows of uninspired alcoholic merchandise, the locals have clearly let the shiny new thing on their doorsteps overexcite them.<br/>
         <br/>
We hear from Woolies' logistics boffins that in Dan Murphy's' first seven weeks of operation, stock of Penfolds Grange has run dry several times and emergency supplies have had to be sourced from other outlets around the city to keep "momentum going" at Grant O'Brien's newest edifice.<br/>
         <br/>
Lord knows how many cashed-up oenologists the Campbelltown and Nepean superstores have had to turn away since they ceded their cellars' best to the Double Bay branch.<br/>
         <br/>
And four bottles of Scotland's finest whisky – Macallan and Glenfiddich – have walked out the door to the tune of $45,000.<br/>
         <br/>
The run on Penfolds stock could be down to Treasury Wine Estates's Michael Clarke almost giving the stuff away with cheap wine fridges and free steak knives.<br/>
         <br/>
Now all O'Brien needs for a profit upgrade are $1 poker machines near the reserve aisle.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Treasury Wine Estates chief executive Mike Clarke's high-stakes gamble on the biggest promotional drive in the history of the company appears to have paid off, as he pushes to evade a potential takeover by private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.<br/>
         <br/>An avalanche of buyers have scooped up a discounted $650 wine fridge by buying six bottles of high-end Penfolds wines after Mr Clarke launched an aggressive advertising blitz for the month of July, which will give Penfolds sales a fast start to the new financial year.<br/>
         <br/>
Under the offer, if drinkers bought six or more bottles of high-end Penfolds wine from a retailer, they could buy a 30-bottle Vintec temperature-controlled wine cabinet for $200 plus $55 in delivery charges, instead of the usual price of $650.<br/>
         <br/>
It is understood that up to 12,000 of the Vintec wine cabinets will be delivered to wine buyers across Australia who have already taken advantage of the promotion and bought at least six bottles of the Penfolds Bin series of luxury wines by July 30.<br/>
         <br/>
The high volume of Vintec cabinets taken up by Penfolds wine buyers under the offer in July mean that Vintec will supply to the Penfolds promotion the same number of cabinets and wine cellar units it normally sells in an entire year. The promotion has been heavily subsidised by Penfolds, which has partnered with Vintec, Australia's market leader in temperature-controlled wine cabinets.<br/>
         <br/>
Penfolds generates about 75 per cent of total profits at Treasury, which three months ago received a $3.1 billion buyout proposal from KKR.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Clarke, who began as chief executive with Treasury on March 31, a few weeks ago outlined a new strategy for Penfolds and labelled the wine cabinet promotion the biggest consumer-facing promotion ever undertaken by the company.<br/>
         <br/>
Liquor retailers say there has been brisk foot traffic and a high take-up of the offer, while Vintec itself says it has been highly successful.Successful strategy<br/>
         <br/>
Vintec group marketing manager Thomas Benhamou declined to comment on specific numbers but said demand was very strong.<br/>
         <br/>
"I can tell you it's been very, very successful,'' he said.<br/>
         <br/>
"We've experienced very good demand.''<br/>
         <br/>
Woolworths superstore liquor chain, Dan Murphy's, has been experiencing strong demand from Penfolds buyers taking up the offer, according to Campbell Stott, merchandise manager for Dan Murphy's.<br/>
         <br/>
"We've seen a pretty good level of demand,'' he said. "I think it's been a good promotional mechanic for them.''<br/>
         <br/>
KKR pitched its buyout proposal at $4.70 per share for Treasury, which also makes the brands Wolf Blass, Rosemount, Lindemans, Wynns and Seppelt.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury shares closed on Friday at $4.99.<br/>
         <br/>
Under Mr Clarke's shift in strategy, the company will release its new range of high-end wines, including the flagship Penfolds Grange, in October each year, away from the traditional release dates of March to May which has been the custom for the past 20 years.<br/>
         <br/>
Key points Biggest promotional drive in company's history looks to be hugely successful. Shares closed on Friday at $4.99 per share compared with the KKR bid of $4.70.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Takeover target Treasury Wine Estates has kicked off an expansion into the $US39 billion ($41.5 billion) global travel retail market to ensure its iconic wines are not left out of luxury buying decisions at the world's newest and most ritziest airports, duty-free shops and cruise liners.<br/>
         <br/>The renewed pitch to the travelling public comes amid a plethora of new airport expansions and openings, especially in the Middle East and Asia.The massive lounges and upmarket shopping precincts are increasingly focused on luxury goods.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury Wine believes the wine ­category is very underdeveloped at ­airports, lagging behind the spirits ­sector which dominates 70 per cent of all ­alcohol sales, and believes its icon winessuch as Penfolds and Wolf Blass can find their way into the shopping bags of high spending global travellers – especially from China.<br/>
         <br/>
After last year's deal with Nuance Group – one of the world's biggest travel retailers – to open a maiden standalone Penfolds store at Sydney Airport, Treasury Wine has appointed Daevid Warren to head up its Middle East and Africa business. He will be based in Dubai where he will also lead the group's global travel retail operations.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Warren will use his 20 years of experience in the retail sector, including stints with World Duty Free and spirits group Bacardi Martini, to ensure the winemaker's leading brands are front and centre at airport lounges, bars and duty-free shops, and on luxury cruise ships. Treasury Wine also appointed two more executives within its global travel retail sales and marketing teams to support the company's lofty earnings ambitions.<br/>
         <br/>
The general retail sector continues to flat-line amid tough conditions and anxious consumers, but the $US39 billion global travel industry is in a strong growth trajectory backed by 4 per cent plus international passenger growth rates (6 per cent plus in Asia), the emergence of low-cost carriers and continued strong investment in new airport terminals with larger retail space.<br/>
         <br/>
But while perfume and cosmetics has traditionally driven and dominated airport retail sales, wine has been left behind and is hugely underdeveloped.<br/>
         <br/>
Wine sales make up 48 per cent of domestic liquor sales but only 21 per cent of the global travel retail ­sector, with spirits taking the lion's share of sales. The current prize is 6.8 million cases a year of wine sold in airport stores, and although Europe is responsible for the bulk of volumes, Asia is forecast to grow at stronger rates.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury Wine has significantly upped its marketing spend for the ­airport and global travel market to latch on to this market, launching displays, pop-up stores and permanent sites for its luxury wines, including airport installations for its recent Penfolds 2014 Bins and icon wines range at Dubai, London, Amsterdam, Singapore and Hong Kong.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Shanghai | Treasury Wine Estates failed to register the Chinese name for Penfolds and is now locked in a protracted legal battle with a notorious trademark squatter in an effort regain ownership of the iconic name.<br/>
         <br/>An investigation by The Australian Financial Review has found that a rival wine company has registered three variations of Penfolds' Chinese name, Ben Fu. This potentially leaves Treasury open to a hefty fine for trademark infringement and could also allow the rival to sell wine using the Chinese name for Penfolds.<br/>
         <br/>
"Treasury has little choice but to buy back the name at a hefty price or relaunch the brand in China," said wine consultant Andy Tan from Mad Wines. "Actually the Chinese company has done nothing wrong. In China the first person to register the name has the right to use it."<br/>
         <br/>
Electronics giant Apple, electric car maker Tesla and French winemaker Castel have all suffered similar problems in China, due to its so called "first to file" rule.<br/>
         <br/>
New Chinese trademark laws which came into effect on May 1, should make this more difficult, but previous judgements have not been favourable for ­foreign companies. Last August a ­Chinese court ordered Castel to pay Yuan33.73 million ($A5.8 million) for trademark infringement, after a rival wine company registered its Chinese name in 2000. Castel is appealing the judgement, but it has abandoned its well-known Chinese name and relaunched the brand.<br/>
         <br/>
Penfolds is up against the same trademark squatter, who won the record judgement against Castel.Chinese names<br/>
         <br/>
In China many consumers can't read the Latin alphabet and therefore the Chinese name and associated characters are often far more important than the English or French brand name.<br/>
         <br/>
Penfolds is considered to have chosen a very good Chinese name, as Ben Fu roughly translates to "dashing towards wealth".<br/>
         <br/>
In a statement to the Financial Review, Treasury said it had been engaged in litigation to "ensure the integrity of the brand" in China for the past three years. Treasury said it won an initial court case, but the defendant has since appealed.<br/>
         <br/>
"This appeal is still pending and it will take time for the Chinese legal system to process this matter," it said without giving a timeframe. Treasury has not previously disclosed the lawsuit.<br/>
         <br/>
The trademark issue comes as Treasury suffers from falling sales in China and as it attempts to fend off a $3 billion takeover bid from private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.<br/>
         <br/>
According to the London-based, International Wine and Spirit Research, China edged out France as the biggest consumer of red wine in 2013. In all categories – white, red and sparkling wine – China is ranked number five, but is drinking twice as much wine as it did five years ago.Notorious trademark squatter<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury's opponent in its Chinese dispute is the notorious trademark squatter Li Daozhi, who also uses the name Daniel Li.<br/>
         <br/>
Another man Li Shen, thought to be a relative of Daniel Li, is also involved.<br/>
         <br/>
A search of the China Trademarks office shows that Li Shen has the rights to use the Ben Fu name until July 2019 and a more artistic drawing of the characters until March 2024. Both of these are registered in the spirits and wine category.<br/>
         <br/>
The Ben Fu name in the hotels, bars and restaurants category is owned by Li Daozhi. He holds this until April 2021. Efforts to contact either of the Li's were unsuccessful.<br/>
         <br/>
Despite Castel appealing the adverse ruling against it in China, Li Doazhi is firmly in control of its Chinese brand name – Kasite.<br/>
         <br/>
He has even used the brand to sponsor the French Olympic fencing team and was the name sponsor of Wine Futures 2012, a major industry conference held in Hong Kong.<br/>
         <br/>
After winning the case against Castel last year, Li Daozhi said money was not his aim. Rather, he wanted to stop "trademark infringement" from those who "want to make money through copying famous brands".<br/>
         <br/>
The Kasite brand has since been awarded the title of "well-known imported wine brand" – the highest ranking given out by China's Trademark office.<br/>
         <br/>
Only five other foreign beverage brands in China have been given this status – Chivas, Remy Martin, Martell and Hennessy.<br/>
         <br/>
The most expensive trademark squatting payout in China was thought to be Apple's efforts to secure use of the iPad name.<br/>
         <br/>
In July 2012 it paid a reported $US60 million to secure use of the name in China, after another company claimed ownership and sought to prevent Apple selling its tablet computer in China.<br/>
         <br/>
Last week a trademark squatter sought 23.9 million yuan in compensation from electric car maker Tesla, claiming it was illegally using its own name in China. The lawsuit also demanded Tesla shut down its Chinese showrooms and service centres.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Treasury Wine Estates (TWE) has endured a tumultuous year. The world's biggest listed wine group has fended off a $3 billion takeover offer from private equity firm KKR &amp; Co, appointed new chief executive Michael Clarke and downgraded earnings.<br/>
         <br/>In June the company, which owns brands such as Penfolds, Rosemount and Wynns, booked a fresh $260 million of write-downs against wine brands in its troubled US business.<br/>
         <br/>
Last week law firm Maurice Blackburn lodged a shareholder class action against the company relating to the disclosure of write-downs against TWE's US business in 2013. TWE has pledged to "vigorously defend" the action.<br/>
         <br/>
But aside from all the noise, some analysts can see value in the company. Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst David Errington reinitiated coverage on the stock with a "neutral" rating and share price target of $5.30.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Errington says TWE is under­achieving its potential given its asset quality. He thinks the current return on equity does not reflect TWE's real value.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Errington's estimated net asset value for the stock is much higher at $6.30 a share, and reflects the poor returns being generated on some of TWE's US and Australian assets. "TWE has outstanding vineyards, wineries [and] brand names and has sizeable inventory levels of luxury wine in storage," he said in a research note.<br/>
         <br/>
TWE shares are down 14 per cent over the past 12 months to about $4.98. The broader market is up almost 15 per cent over the same period.<br/>
         <br/>
Deutsche Bank analyst Michael ­Simotas said earnings figures from TWE's US peer, Constellation Brands, suggested TWE's US business will struggle. "Conditions in the US wine market remain tough with weak underlying volumes and lack of price growth .  We expect TWE's US business to remain challenged," he told clients.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Legal firm Maurice Blackburn lodged documents in the Federal Court on Wednesday to begin a class action lawsuit against Treasury Wine Estates, on behalf of more than 600 shareholders, over what it claims was a late disclosure of heavy write-downs relating to its United States business in 2013.<br/>
         <br/>The lawsuit is being funded by Bentham IMF.<br/>
         <br/>
Maurice Blackburn principal Rebecca Gilsenan filed the class action in the Sydney court. The ­documents do not specify the size of the claim but it is expected to run into the "tens of ­millions".<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury Wine said in a note to the ASX on Wednesday it "strongly denies any and all allegations against it and will vigorously defend the legal ­proceeding''.<br/>
         <br/>
The claim alleges Treasury, whose brands include Penfolds, Rosemount, Lindemans and Wynns, misled the market and breached its continuous disclosure obligations in relation to the financial impact of over-stocked third-party distributors in the US.<br/>
         <br/>
It is the second class action lawsuit that has flowed from Treasury's ­surprise $160 million write-down and profit warning in July 2013, which also included the infamous revelations that up to $35 million worth of low-priced bottled wine in the US would need to be disposed of through the systematic crushing of thousands of cartons of ­bottled wine.<br/>
         <br/>
Ms Gilsenan said the action was being brought on behalf of Treasury shareholders "who lost millions of dollars when the company revealed the full extent of the problem in July last year".<br/>
         <br/>
She said the documents didn't ­specify a figure for the size of the claim but "we expect and anticipate it would be in the tens of millions".<br/>
         <br/>
Ms Gilsenan said the case would present evidence that Treasury knew, or should have known by August 17, 2012, that large write-downs were ­inevitable and that the market should have been alerted far earlier.<br/>
         <br/>
"It wasn't informed until July 2013, so shareholders unfairly paid an inflated price for the stock in the meantime."<br/>
         <br/>
Melbourne lawyer Mark Elliott, via his specialist class action vehicle Melbourne City Investments, has pursued a separate class action against Treasury in the Supreme Court of Victoria.Unwelcome distraction<br/>
         <br/>
The Maurice Blackburn proceedings are an unwelcome distraction for Treasury. It received a buyout proposal from US private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts on April 16 which it ­disclosed on May 20.<br/>
         <br/>
That proposal, pitched at $4.70 per share, valued Treasury at $3.1 billion but was firmly rejected by the Treasury board as undervaluing the company. But the board hasn't revealed what sort of price might prompt it to reconsider.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury said in its announcement to the ASX on Wednesday that the Federal Court documents lodged by Maurice Blackburn names the applicant as Brian Jones, who bought 1000 shares in Treasury on September 21, 2012 at an average price of $4.76 per share.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Jones brings the claim on his own behalf and that of other persons who have entered into the litigation funding agreement with Bentham IMF. The claim alleges contraventions of continuous disclosure obligations and misleading and deceptive conduct.<br/>
         <br/>
Also on Wednesday, Treasury announced former Coca-Cola ­executive Robert Foye had been appointed managing director for the wine group in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Foye, a US citizen, will be based in Shanghai and report directly to Treasury chief executive Mike Clarke, who worked with Mr Foye earlier in his career when they were both at the soft drinks group.<br/>
         <br/>
Key points<br/>
         <br/>
Shareholders say Treasury misled market with late disclosure of heavy write-downs in its US business.<br/>
         <br/>
Investors 'expect and anticipate' to reclaim tens of millions of dollars.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Treasury undergoing shake-up to realign brands.<br/>
         <br/>Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Gucci, Prada, Cartier, Moet &amp; Chandon, Penfolds. Is there an odd one out?<br/>
         <br/>
The venerable Penfolds, which has a history stretching back to 1844, is preparing to make a concerted push to elevate itself to join the ranks of the world's luxury goods brands. It is vying for the same increased status as Australian boot maker R.M.Williams, which itself has grand plans to become a global heavyweight now that a private equity firm backed by luxury goods giant LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton holds a 49.9 per cent stake.<br/>
         <br/>
One part of Penfolds is already in this rarefied air: the $785-per-bottle Penfolds Grange, which has earned its spot as a luxury item around the world and is Australia's most famous wine. But those wanting a cheap and cheerful bottle of red to go with their chops and steak on the barbecue only have to pay around $12.80 for a Penfolds Koonunga Hill shiraz.<br/>
         <br/>
The gulf between the top and bottom of the Penfolds range is one of the great conundrums for the brand, which makes up 75 per cent of the total profits generated by Treasury Wine Estates.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury's new chief executive Mike Clarke is trying to overhaul the company to act more like the custodian of fine wine brands and less like a grocery business stuffing its product onto shelves in a rush towards the end of each financial year to make sure it meets its profit targets.

         <br/>
Clarke, a British food executive who joined Treasury on March 31, is implementing the biggest shake-up at Penfolds in 20 years. He's shifting the release date of high-end Penfolds wines each year to mid-October, away from the usual March and May. The obsession with Penfolds Grange among fine wine buffs reaches fever pitch each year on May 1 when the latest drop is released, so it requires a ­substantial shift in consumer behaviour.<br/>
         <br/>
A plus for Treasury is the 2010 Penfolds Grange, which will come out of the blocks in October, eight months before its previously slated release date, is from a harvest that produced high-quality wines.Top scores from those in the know<br/>
         <br/>
Peter Gago, who has been Penfolds chief winemaker for the past 12 years and has been with Penfolds for 25 years, is absolutely convinced of the merits of the 2010. His 2008 Penfolds Grange received 100 points out of 100 from esteemed US wine publication the Wine Spectator, and a similar perfect score from noted US wine critic Robert Parker.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Gago already struts the international stage conducting wine tastings and master classes with the elite, and only last week was in Monaco holding court at a gathering of hedge funds and investment firms eager to taste the top-tier Penfolds wines. "Grange has cachet. It has crowd appeal. It's real currency," he said.<br/>
         <br/>
He has a vested interest, but Mr Gago said the shift to later in the calendar year has been championed by the winemaking staff for years but had been resisted by corporate executives until Mr Clarke came along. "This has been something the winemakers at Penfolds have been pushing for since I've been here," he said.<br/>
         <br/>
Luxury goods sales generally are growing at a quicker rate than other retail staples around the world. A report last year by consulting firm Bain &amp; Co estimated that luxury goods would grow 50 per cent faster than world GDP and break through the €250 billion ($361 billion) mark by 2015. This is being driven by higher consumption by increasingly mobile tourists, the rise of the middle class in emerging countries like China and India and growth in a strand of society that Bain &amp; Co termed "HENRYs" – High Earnings, Not Rich Yet – who like to splash their cash around.<br/>
         <br/>
So how will Penfolds fare as it pushes to move up the ranks? Mr Clarke is undertaking a structural separation inside Treasury where the luxury brands such as Penfolds will be overseen by a separate unit away from more commercial brands such as Rosemount and Lindemans.<br/>
         <br/>
Professor Mark Ritson, a retailing expert from the Melbourne Business School said the definition of what is a luxury item keeps changing and there is no hard and fast rule. "In Australia 40 years ago having a colour television was deemed to be a luxury good," he said.<br/>
         <br/>
He believes Mr Clarke is heading in the right direction with his plans, but there are question marks about having the brand selling at relatively low prices for some labels, right up to the top-tier Grange. "The question you should ask is whether the brand architecture can take it?" Professor Ritson said.<br/>
         <br/>
He compares that approach to the Volkswagen Group in the automotive group which has different brands for different price points. It owns Audi at the upper end, Volkswagen at the mid-tier and Skoda as a cheaper brand.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Treasury Wine Estates is looking to strike exclusive supply deals with major liquor retailers Woolworths and Coles whereby it will only sell some of its lesser-known brands in outlets ­controlled by the two firms.<br/>
         <br/>The deals to quarantine some of those brands to be sold only in Woolworths outlets, or only those operated by Coles, are part of the plan by new chief executive Mike Clarke to try and generate better growth at the less profitable end of Treasury's 83-strong wine brand portfolio.<br/>
         <br/>
"We are going to have a good look at Brand A as an exclusive," Mr Clarke said.<br/>
         <br/>
He declined to specify which of the more commercial brands might be included in this strategy built around a retailer exclusive.<br/>
         <br/>
Other large independent liquor chains may also be involved in separate exclusive deals.<br/>
         <br/>
There are also plans to remove between 10 to 15 brands from the lower-end of the portfolio either through a sale, a joint-venture arrangement or by simply discontinuing a brand.<br/>
         <br/>
That whittling down of the portfolio would be a gradual staged process to extract maximum value and avoid a fire sale of brands all in one hit.<br/>
         <br/>
"They could be sold or they could be a joint venture," he said.<br/>
         <br/>
But the top 20 "power brands" which Mr Clarke has outlined for several weeks as being integral to his turnaround strategy for Treasury and which will receive most of a 50 per cent increase in marketing spend will be untouchable in the overhaul. A collection of around 20 other brands which are referred to internally at Treasury as "regional champions" will also be quarantined. Big-selling commercial brands including Rosemount and Lindemans will also be the recipients of major investment in brand-building.<br/>
         <br/>
The "power brands" include Penfolds, Wolf Blass, Wynns, Matua from New Zealand and the Californian wine brands Chateau St Jean and Beringer.release date of high-end lines changed<br/>
         <br/>
Those in the next set of around 20 brands in the regional champions list include Devil's Lair from Western ­Australia's Margaret River region and Coldstream Hills from Victoria's Yarra Valley.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury shares continued to rise on Thursday, gaining 1.3 per cent by mid-day to be at $5.13 before fading to close 2¢ higher at $5.09. This followed a strong gain of 5 per cent on Wednesday after an announcement that included another hefty write-down of $260 million on commercial wine brands and infrastructure mainly related to the US , and plans to shift the release date of high-end Penfolds wines to October.<br/>
         <br/>
While not spelling it out specifically – there was no mention of any profit downgrade – Treasury in practical terms also affirmed on Wednesday that it had met a full-year profit forecast band of between $190 million to $210 million in earnings.<br/>
         <br/>
Private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts made a $4.70 per share buyout proposal for Treasury on April 16 which only became public on May 20. It valued Treasury at $3.1 billion but was rejected by the Treasury board.<br/>
         <br/>
The shift of the Penfolds releases from March and May to October will undo two decades of convention and mean there will be a second release of the flagship Penfolds Grange this year in October.<br/>
         <br/>
The 2010 Grange will be released then, just six months after the 2009 version was released on May 1 this year with a retail price of $785 per bottle.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Clarke said Woolworths and Coles were both receptive to the changes to the high-end Penfolds wine release date changes, and he had been in high-level talks with them for almost two months about it rather than just spring the changes upon them.<br/>
         <br/>
"Positive and engaged,'' he said when asked about what the big retailers thought about the changes to the ­Penfolds timetable.<br/>
         <br/>
Woolworths owns the Dan Murphy's liquor superstores chain along with the mid-market BWS chain, while Coles runs First Choice, Liquorland and Vintage Cellars.<br/>
         <br/>
Stockbroker Citi warned in a note on Treasury after the raft of announcements on Wednesday there was a risk of a disappointing 2014-15 at Treasury. Analysts Gino Rossi and Craig Woolford suggested the possibility of a weak financial result in 2014-15 meant "that KKR or any other suitors can afford to be patient".<br/>
         <br/>
They recommended that investors sell their Treasury shares: "With the share price running ahead of KKR's $4.70 bid we think the risks around a weak FY15 result outweigh any potential upside from a higher bid."<br/>
         <br/>
One of their concerns is that Treasury appeared to be running behind schedule in its efforts to re-adjust inventory levels in the United States operations after running into serious problems in 2013 with too much stock in the warehouses of third-party distributors.<br/>
         <br/>
The analysts suggested that a "stock destruction" part of the plan had happened, but that plans to ship fewer cases of wine into the distributors system to ensure that any oversupply into the market was well and truly eradicated still had further to go and there would need to be a further deliberate slowing of shipments in the 2014-15 year.<br/>
         <br/>
The troubles in the US last year led to the axeing of former Treasury chief executive David Dearie in late 2013, who was replaced by Mr Clarke on March 31 this year.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury in mid-2013 announced $160 million of write-downs connected with the US business including an infamous move to destroy $35 million worth of bottled wine in distributors' warehouses.<br/>
         <br/>
This involved the crushing of six million bottles of low-priced wine in cartons using steamrollers and special environmental clean-up techniques.</div>

         <br/>The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX 200 Index lost 0.6 per cent on Wednesday, to 5402 points, while the broader All Ordinaries Index fell 0.5 per cent to 5386.8 points, as weakness in the biggest bank stocks added to the selling pressure.<br/>
         <br/>
Local shares fell as expected when the market opened after Wall Street declined on Tuesday night. Asian markets provided a negative lead in the afternoon session.<br/>
         <br/>
Energy was the worst performing sector on the local bourse, down 0.9 per cent. Australia's biggest oil producer Woodside Petroleum fell 0.5 per cent to $41.38, as Brent crude oil dipped to $US114.22 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude oil lifted to $US106.67 a barrel.<br/>

Local energy producers are bucking a global trend seen over recent weeks, whereby oil and gas companies in most markets have risen in response to risks to the global oil supply from Iraq and Ukraine.BHP, Rio fall<br/>
         <br/>
"Australian oil and gas producers have under-performed their global peers in recent weeks in reaction to some short-term local issues," Pengana Capital senior fund manager Tim Schroeders said.<br/>
         <br/>
"Some investors sold down their interests in smaller energy players to mop up discounted stock from Royal Dutch Shell's sell-down of Woodside, while other people have been switching some of their money into mining stocks after that sector suffered heavy price falls," Mr Schroeders said.<br/>
         <br/>
Resources giant BHP Billiton fell 0.7 per cent to $36.21 despite analysts welcoming a plan announced on Tuesday to cut an extra 500 plus jobs. BHP's main rival Rio Tinto shed 0.8 per cent to $59.07, while iron ore miner Fortescue Metals Group was unchanged at $4.36, after the spot price for iron ore, delivered in China, eased 0.1 per cent to $US93.30 a tonne. When the local market closed on Wednesday, Dalian iron ore futures indicated the spot price was set to lift overnight.<br/>
         <br/>
But longer term investors are bracing for weaker average iron ore prices for at least the next 12 months. Australia's Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics cut its price forecasts for the nation's biggest export. The official government forecast is now tipping the iron ore spot price will average $US97 a tonne in 2015, down from the $US103 estimated in March.<br/>
         <br/>
Investor sentiment took another hit from an official monthly government survey that showed a 1.3 per cent decline in the number of employers advertising to fill skilled positions in May. The data was interpreted by many as a sign the federal budget has had a material effect on confidence.<br/>
         <br/>
The big four banks were also lower. Commonwealth Bank of Australia fell 0.7 per cent to $81.02, while Westpac Banking Corporation shed 0.9 per cent to $33.83. ANZ Banking Group lost 0.6 per cent to $33.42, and National Australia Bank declined 0.9 per cent to $32.90.<br/>

              <div class="document-view__body">Malaysian billionaire KT Lim slipped quietly into Sydney this week to meet with the state's gaming regulator. The timing was significant. It is exactly two years since Lim's Genting Group lodged an application to increase its stake in Echo Entertainment beyond 10 per cent.<br/>
         <br/>This is an extraordinarily long time, even in the tightly regulated gaming world. James Packer had his application to increase his stake in Echo approved in a year, while it took six months for the Nevada Gaming Commission to grant Genting approval for a resort in Las Vegas. Lim is running out of patience and met with the NSW Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority (ILGA) on Tuesday to try to get to the ­bottom of the delay.<br/>
         <br/>
Genting has long been the wild card in the feud between Echo and James Packer's Crown over control of the Sydney casino market. The Asian gaming group has taken a low profile in the past year though and Echo executives and investors have been bemused about why the  gaming regulator has taken so long to consider its application.<br/>
         <br/>
Lim's presence in Sydney indicates he is still serious about building a presence in Australia. It also suggests it is not Genting dragging out the approval process by not submitting the required information as some have suggested. Unlike his trip to the country in April last year, the Genting chief executive was not accompanied by his usual entourage. His visit was brief and he flew out on Tuesday night. There were no formal meetings scheduled with Echo.<br/>
         <br/>
Genting has enormous gaming interests across Asia and plenty of free cash which would make it an attractive partner for Echo which is seeking to increase the number of Asian VIP gamblers coming to Sydney.<br/>
         <br/>
Genting is also a potential acquirer of Echo, either by itself or with a partner. While Packer sold his 10 per cent stake in May last year and has since been given the green light to operate a second casino in Sydney, some investors still see Echo as a potential target.<br/>
         <br/>
Some analysts believe Genting no longer has ambitions for Echo because it did not seek to team up with it on Brisbane's Queen's Wharf project. Echo announced this week it had partnered with Hong Kong's Chow Tai Fook and Far East Consortium to bid for the multibillion-dollar Brisbane casino and entertainment precinct.<br/>
         <br/>
But that does not necessarily stop Genting buying Echo, which would be the Brisbane project's operator if it wins the bidding process. The decision by the NSW government to give Packer the go ahead to operate a second casino in Sydney has enhanced, rather than reduced, Genting's interest in Australia<br/>
         <br/>
Crown Resorts competes with Genting in Asia and Packer's ability to capitalise on the flow of VIP gamers between Australia and Asia is something Lim cannot do at the moment. Genting owns casinos in Malaysia, Singapore, the United States and Britain and has interests in mining and agriculture assets. Lim has presented the company as potentially a significant investor in New South Wales' tourism infrastructure at a time when mining investment is slowing.<br/>
         <br/>
This looks doubtful if Genting runs out of patience and walks away. The regulatory approval process is normal as NSW gaming rules mean any single shareholder must seek permission from the regulator to increase its stake beyond 10 per cent. But the time it is taking to reach a conclusion is ­raising eyebrows.<br/>
         <br/>
The ILGA says it continues to work with Genting about its application and the matter remains under consideration.<br/>
         <br/>
Shifting the release date of its top Penfolds wine brands is a brave move for Treasury Wine Estates as new chief Mike Clarke seeks to reboot the business after a shocking ­couple of years.<br/>
         <br/>
Penfolds, undoubtedly the jewel in ­Treasury's crown, has shifted the market release date for its top wines from March and May to October. This is a big mental shift for the company and a change that was resisted by former management.<br/>
         <br/>
Clarke says the list of positives outweighs the negatives. It allows Treasury to market its most profitable product better in the run-up to Christmas and abolishes the mad rush to sell product into warehouses before the end of the financial year.<br/>
         <br/>
It also allows it to move wine in cooler conditions.<br/>
         <br/>
Clarke initially looked at changing the company's financial year to get around that problem but was asked by his senior ­management team to change the launch dates instead.<br/>
         <br/>
This is an important marketing tweak but it does not solve all of Treasury's problems. The company took a further write-down on Wednesday for assets it paid too much for when it was still owned by Foster's.<br/>
         <br/>
But investors were happy the company was not downgrading earnings guidance after Clarke said he was feeling "pretty ­positive" about financial year 2014 forecasts.<br/>
         <br/>
This strengthens its defence slightly against private equity suitor KKR which had its $4.70 offer for the company rebuffed by the board in April.<br/>
         <br/>
There are no formal talks going on between the two but investors and the board are said to be open-minded to an offer of $5 or more.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury shares closed up 5 per cent at $5.07 on Wednesday, suggesting investors are confident KKR may up its original approach or another bidder will join the fray.<br/>
         <br/>
A break-up still looks inevitable if ­private equity moves in – and there appears to be no shortage of buyers for the US operations.<br/>
         <br/>
One of the country's leading CEOs says when you start in the top job you have a ­six-week period in which to blame your predecessor for all the company's mistakes. After that, it is time to man up and get things right.<br/>
         <br/>
Clarke's grace period is now up and with Wednesday's announcement he is making some progress at least with a restructuring plan, although the jury is still out.<br/>
         <br/>
Competition regulation is a hot topic at the moment as Ian Harper prepares the biggest inquiry into the issue in two decades.<br/>
         <br/>
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman Rod Sims has made it loud and clear this week he has issues with the upcoming wave of state government ­privatisations. He reiterated his concerns in the ACCC's submission to the Harper review on Wednesday.<br/>
         <br/>
It was no coincidence this coincided with the Australian Competition Tribunal's ­decision to back AGL's $1.5 billion acquisition of state-owned Macquarie Generation. The ruling is contentious as it overrules the ACCC's decision in March to block the sale and has huge implications for billions of ­dollars in upcoming asset sale programs.<br/>
         <br/>
Working in AGL's favour was a commitment to supply electricity hedge contracts to smaller retailers which alleviated some of the concerns.<br/>
         <br/>
Governments have accused Sims of ­getting too involved in public policy rather than being a regulator but he says he is just doing his job.<br/>
         <br/>
The ACCC says its position is based on the fact that the deal means three of NSW's ­largest generators will be sold to the three largest retailers, reducing competition in the electricity market.<br/>
         <br/>
Sims has high hopes for the Harper review and says the emphasis is getting ­competition back on centre stage, as well as stripping out different regulations between the states which are hurting businesses.<br/>
         <br/>
Business and Sims will never see eye to eye for obvious reason. Sims says he accepts that companies must pursue the profit motive as long as they do so in accordance with competition laws. But he says the ­existing regulations are deficient and out of step with comparable markets like Britain, the US, Japan and Korea.<br/>
         <br/>
Sims is proposing more clout for the ACCC to address the misuse of market power. He wants limitations on the ACCC's information gathering powers eased as well as the ability to conduct market studies.<br/>
         <br/>
The Macquarie Generation decision is a blow for Sims who says he won't be rushed into making quick decisions around ­potential bidders for state-owned assets without the appropriate access regimes.<br/>

              <div class="document-view__body">There are two firm conclusions to draw from the latest rich bank of impairments and provisions confirmed by Aurizon, the nation's biggest rail freighter.<br/>
         <br/>First, Australian coal's long-drafted growth story is as stuffed as coal's current price. Second, the workplace inefficiencies, sustained by rail unions, come at an absurdly high cost to Aurizon shareholders specifically and the nation more broadly.<br/>
         <br/>
Within the bounds of standing employment agreements, Aurizon has been reorganising its train operations for the better part of a year now.<br/>
         <br/>
As a result it is doing more with less rolling stock. That means it has now twice reviewed the valuation of the locomotives and wagons it owns.<br/>
         <br/>
The Casey Jones of this efficiency drive is an import from Canadian Pacific called Mike Franczak. With new eyes set on old problems, Franczak has set about changing Aurizon's operational game with irresistible purpose and energy.<br/>
         <br/>
Much of the financial heavy lifting generated by Franczak's efficiency drive was done in the first half as Aurizon booked $147 million of impairments. But on Thursday it added up to $25 million to that number after further work on what is called the "Integrated Operating Plan".<br/>
         <br/>
That work identified Aurizon was still running 20 more locos than it needed, and 195 wagons.<br/>
         <br/>
As we have reported, Aurizon is knee deep in a negotiations with rail unions over a new enterprise agreement that would bring the terms and conditions of the train drivers' employment, among others, into the 21st century.<br/>
         <br/>
At that point, I presume, unless there is some underlying growth in the volume of coal and freight Aurizon might be asked to carry, we might well see further advances in efficiency that require similar sorts of financial concessions.<br/>
         <br/>
And what of the coal story? Well, Aurizon will take a second-half impairment of up to $45 million on the preparations for growth projects in Queensland coal that the company believes will not now happen. They include the recently scrapped plan for a new coal terminal at Dudgeon Point, and the slated expansion of the Wiggins Island terminal, the first phase of which is still a work in progress.<br/>
         <br/>
For good measure Aurizon has taken a $6 million write-down on work done on expansion of its North Queensland network ahead of the decision in March to align itself with GVK Hancock's Galilee Basin venture.<br/>
         <br/>
Interestingly, at least for train track spotters like me, Aurizon also took a $19 million hit on the work it did for potential customers in the Pilbara.<br/>
         <br/>
That size of that number says Aurizon's interest in the mooted east Pilbara link, was either serious or a very expensive indulgence. And the decision to write off that work says that Aurizon is now extremely confident of success in its $1.4 billion joint venture bid for Aquila Resources.<br/>
         <br/>
Aquila is the owner of a proposal that requires the construction of $6 billion worth of railway and port on the Pilbara's south-western flank. And presently, events suggest Aurizon and senior partner Baosteel are almost in control of that proposition.<br/>
         <br/>
To that end, of course, the decision by Aquila co-founder, Charles Bass, to sell into the offer is sweet cream on the cake baked by last week's recommendation of the bid by the junior's board.<br/>
         <br/>
That recommendation arrived with slightly conditional acceptance by Aquila's chairman Tony Poli. He owns 28 per cent of the company while Bass owns another 10.7 per cent.<br/>
         <br/>
As Baosteel opened this control pitch with a 20 per cent stake, the joint venture now speaks for 58.7 per cent of the business.<br/>
         <br/>
Given this situation is not complicated by further, last-minute intervention, that leaves Baosteel and Aurizon with control and with satisfaction of its key 50.1 per cent acceptance condition.<br/>
         <br/>
Heavy weight of reform<br/>
         <br/>
If Michael Clarke sensed his latest message of reform at Treasury Wine Estates was falling on excessively cautious ears, then he would be right.<br/>
         <br/>
Just four months into the Clarke era at TWE and he has taken not one but two reform packages to the market. That both of them are refreshingly sensible, consistent with his introductory pitch and transparently discrete in their impact, does not matter a whole lot.<br/>
         <br/>
The problem for Clarke is that reform fatigue weighs heavy among TWE watchers. Pretty much ever since this business was seeded within former owner Foster's Brewing Group through a $482 million acquisition of Mildara Blass, these sort of transformational plans have come and gone as rapidly as executive management.<br/>
         <br/>
So far the TWE story has run to the same script since it was gifted independence from beer in May 2011. New management affirmed a plan, things went awry, the board lost patience and, before you know it, we have a new executive broom and a spanking new transformational plan.<br/>
         <br/>
Now, the very least we can hope this time around is that TWE's new, but already crisis-scarred, board might exhibit confidence and patience in Clarke, his method and the "step-changes" he now proposes for what should be our national champion.<br/>
         <br/>
Clarke arrived at TWE in February with a four-point action template. He would pursue better execution of existing plans, reduce costs, increase marketing by 50 per cent and address the deeper structural challenges.<br/>
         <br/>
In May he dealt with the first two step, asserting more direct authority over the business and confirming a $35 million target for cost reduction for fiscal year 2014.<br/>
         <br/>
Now he has dealt with some of those more structural problems.<br/>
         <br/>
Clarke will consolidate and bring foward the date to release the all-important Penfolds bins and luxury wines. He will also structurally separate across each of his diverse operational geographies, the commercial wine business from the luxury and (dreadfully monickered) "masstige" brands.Both moves are so dreadfully logical it is hard to believe they were not done long ago.<br/>
         <br/>
The difference between commercial wine and the stuff that generates real margin is like the difference between cheese slices and a dripping brie. One is manufactured, the other is the product of age-old craft and contemporary genius.Time to flourish<br/>
         <br/>
Clarke's new structure aims at allowing both sides of his production equation to flourish without either harming the other.<br/>
         <br/>
Shifting the Penfolds releases to a single date in October loomed potentially somewhat more controversial in that it has a compelling logic. The decision brings forward by six months the 2014 releases. It will distort 2015 numbers, making it very difficult for the market to track the underlying business.<br/>
         <br/>
It says much about Clarke's savvy that the optics of this move were handled so well. By simply acknowledging the reality that his numbers will be hard to track through the "reset" year of FY15, Clarke defused debate over his numbers.<br/>
         <br/>
And by introducing Penfolds' chief winemaker, the irrepressible Pete Gago, to Wednesday's briefing, he settled debate over where the initiative came from. Gago made it abundantly clear the Penfolds family was right behind the change, welcoming it as the expression of an "enlightened executive" with the courage to accept advice offered to others for years.<br/>
         <br/>
Gago noted too October was a much more sensible time of the year to be shipping wine, and the opportunity to market his product over a full financial year rather than over just the June quarter, offered new opportunity to extract margin through astute stock management.<br/>
         <br/>
The proposition is at the heart of Clarke's strategy. Like any sensible person, he identified Penfolds as the wellspring of his business. What puzzled him was why its bounty was released in two stages through May, leaving the business under pressure to move as much stock as possible in the closing months of the financial year.<br/>
         <br/>
Clarke's original idea was to shift his year-end reporting date to September or December. Gago's guys had a better idea. Why not recover history and move to the October release date that set the Penfolds calendar 35 years ago?</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Treasury Wine Estates chief executive Mike Clarke says his bold strategy to break decades of convention and shifting the release date of high-end Penfolds wines is part of a "roadmap'' any owner of the wine group should implement.<br/>
         <br/>Mr Clarke unveiled the new strategy on Wednesday along with a fresh set of writedowns of up to $260 million mainly connected with the company's troubled United States wine business.<br/>
         <br/>
A relieved sharemarket largely ignored another hefty writedown by the world's largest stand-alone listed wine company and focused instead on the fact that Treasury had met its own full-year forecasts for 2013-14.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury shares climbed almost 5 per cent, up 24¢ to $5.07, putting pressure on private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts to contemplate a higher offer than the $4.70 per share buyout proposal originally made in mid-April. Meeting profit targets had been one of the conditions in the KKR proposal.<br/>
         <br/>
The high-risk strategy for the Penfolds business of moving the release date from the usual March and May timetable to October is designed to smooth out sales of the brand throughout the whole year, rather than ­compress them into the last part of the financial year when there is a rush to meet profit targets.<br/>
         <br/>
Penfolds makes up to 75 per cent of the profits at Treasury, which has 83 different wine brands in a sprawling empire that Mr Clarke intends trimming back to a more manageable and efficient stable. Mr Clarke and his chief financial officer Tony Reeves said on Wednesday the majority of the new $260 million in writedowns and impairments were connected with the US business and low-end commercial wine brands selling for below $US10 ($10.6) per bottle, but they declined to reveal the specific brands. This is on top of $160 million in writedowns revealed by Treasury in its US business in mid-2013 which included the now infamous destruction of $35 million of excess low-priced bottled wine. Mr Clarke said the Penfolds shift would swing the company away from a "short-term mindset'' where it was always bustling to ship Penfolds into warehouses in a rush towards the end of the June 30 financial year. "It just became a ridiculous process with retail partners and distributors,'' he said. Penfolds would now be treated as "revered, scarce and special" through the change. Treasury would be able to meet its full-year profit guidance of between $190 million to $210 million on an earnings before interest, tax and the SGARA accounting standard basis, without specifically saying so.<br/>
         <br/>
"You can sense we're feeling pretty positive,'' Mr Clarke said. Meeting that guidance was a condition of a $3.1 billion buyout proposal from KKR revealed publicly last month. Mr Clarke said the announcements about the shift in Penfolds releases and the writedowns had no implications for any takeover activity and Treasury was getting on with the job of implementing ''the roadmap'' to fuel future growth. He warned that 2014-15 was a "reset year", but didn't quantify what that meant in terms of future profit forecasts. Treasury, which also owns Rosemount, Lindeman's, Wynns and Wolf Blass, revealed the impairments comprised writedowns of historical prices paid for wine businesses before Treasury was demerged from Foster's in 2011, along with impairments on a string of winery assets at the lower-priced commercial end of the market.Heavy writedowns<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Clarke couldn't promise that would be the last of the writedowns but hoped it would be the case. He also announced a restructuring of its Australian operations and is setting up a separate unit to look after more expensive wines .He also signalled that more of those high-end wines including Penfolds Grange, would be sold in the United States, Europe and Asia and less in Australia. Andrew Carter, the chief commercial officer for Australia, Pacific and Europe, will depart the organisation because of that restructure.<br/>
         <br/>
Penfolds chief winemaker Peter Gago, who oversees the Penfold's Grange and other high-end reds, said there was only a minor risk in the shift of releases, which brings forward the sale of those wines by up to eight months when they would have previously been still in maturation in a one-off change. "A little minor risk this year but going forward it's all sunshine,'' Mr Gago said. Owner of fine wine retailer East End Cellars, Michael Andrewartha, was puzzled by the change in Penfolds release strategy, saying it would "put people in a spin".and make it harder for Penfolds in a crowded pre-Christmas market.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Global suitors are emerging out of the woodwork for Treasury Wine Estates, setting the stage for a potential bidding war for the ailing owner of Australia's best known wine brands.<br/>
         <br/>According to sources, LVMH, the luxury goods brand controlled by French tycoon, Bernard Arnault, is mulling whether to submit a full offer for the business or prise off the coveted Penfolds brand as part of a takeover consortium.<br/>
         <br/>
Bright Food, the Chinese state-owned food group, is also circling, although some question its determination to pursue Treasury given its performance in previous merger and acquisition scenarios in Australia.<br/>
         <br/>
Constellation Brands, the world's largest wine seller has also been crunching the numbers with sources pointing to a potential consortium involving one of the US buyout firms.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury's US arm, which includes Beringer, is widely regarded as the least attractive part of the business.<br/>
         <br/>
Sources claimed a revival in its fortunes could take three or four years and argue the challenge is best suited to a private equity player.<br/>
         <br/>
KKR submitted an offer of $4.70 per share or $3.1 billion for Treasury last month but was given short shrift by the board, which deemed the bid too cheap and vowed to carry on instead with a turnaround plan that involves a 50 per cent increase in the marketing outlay as well as a swingeing cost-cutting regime.<br/>
         <br/>
Yet the improvements are unlikely to affect this financial year's performance. As JPMorgan noted recently, Treasury will struggle to hit its 2014 earning guidance, arguing luxury wine sales in May and June will be pivotal to the outcome.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury is said to be preparing an announcement, which could come as early as Wednesday, confirming the weak conditions. But it is understood management will also seek to allay investor concerns that the entire business model is flawed, as was suggested in a trade publication this week.<br/>
         <br/>
The denouncement comes as many in the market question Treasury's abrupt rejection of KKR's approach.<br/>
         <br/>
According to sources the company's advisers, Goldman Sachs have been working hard to drum up competing interest in the company, which ranks as one of the world's largest pure play winemakers. But these players may not submit a proposal and even if a rival bid does emerge few believe it will be pitched at a significantly higher level than KKR's. Those familiar with the matter argue the buyout firm would not countenance an increase of more than 5 per cent on its existing offer.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">United States private equity firm ­Kohlberg Kravis Roberts is understood to have made fresh soundings to major institutional shareholders in Treasury Wine Estates as the wine company prepares to cut about 100 staff by June 30.<br/>
         <br/>New chief executive Mike Clarke is aggressively pushing to cut costs. The company is preparing for two large redundancies tranches in a restructure which may axe slightly more than the 5 per cent of the workforce target ­outlined by the company last month.<br/>
         <br/>
About 100 Treasury staff in middle management, administration, logistics and distribution, and some contractors, will be made redundant by the end of June – between 50 and 60 per cent of the broader restructuring.<br/>
         <br/>
In the next and final wave of the ­cost-cutting, up to 60 people will lose their jobs by the end of September. A small number of staff have already left after Mr Clarke outlined a $35 million cost-cutting program on May 20 when the wine group, whose brands include ­Penfolds and Rosemount, rejected an indicative buyout proposal from KKR pitched at $4.70 a share.<br/>
         <br/>
Most of the restructuring and ­thinning out of middle management layers is occurring in the United States and Australian operations. A ­substantial portion of the cuts is from the ­company's head office in Queensbridge Street in the Melbourne suburb of Southbank .<br/>
         <br/>
It comes as some large institutional shareholders in Treasury have again been approached by KKR and its ­advisers who seek to outline the rationale for its proposal at $4.70 a share.Direct approach<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Clarke explained on May 20 when the company first revealed the confidential proposal from KKR on April 16, that it decided to publicly reveal the approach because it had learned KKR had directly approached some of Treasury's own shareholders.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Clarke and his board were ­worried the "confidentiality" of the KKR proposal had therefore been lost.<br/>
         <br/>
The public announcement of the ­previously secret KKR proposal came five weeks after it was received, and also after Treasury had publicly rejected speculation during that five-week period about other potential buyers such as Pernod Ricard and Constellation Brands being involved in possible deals.<br/>
         <br/>
Advisers to KKR are thought to have again approached some of Treasury's main institutional shareholders in the past few days.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury's share price has ­continued to soften in the past few days and slipped a further 7¢ on Wednesday to close at $4.82.<br/>
         <br/>
The share price is now in danger of sinking below the $4.70 ­indicative ­proposal price from KKR.Shares on a 10-month high</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Food and beverage companies are among those ripe for the picking, writes Jared Lynch .<br/>
         <br/>Globally, $US504 billion worth of merger and acquisition deals have been struck; it was $US142 billion for the same period last year. With action picking up in Australia as well, we take a look at which sectors and companies here are potential takeovers.<br/>
         <br/>
After two years of disciplined spending, the sector is waking from its M&amp;A slumber. Graeme Browning, an Ernst Young partner who leads transaction advisory services, says valuations have fallen to a point where deals are becoming attractive to mining and mining services companies.<br/>
         <br/>
M&amp;A  activity among resource companies fell for a third year in 2013. The number of deals dropped 25 per cent year on year amid intense volatility in metals prices, particularly iron ore, Australia's most lucrative export. Browning says many mining services companies face financial stress after spending cuts, so he expects consolidation.<br/>
         <br/>
Holly Stiles, Grant Thornton partner focusing on energy and resources, expects deals to start flowing among metal producers, particularly those enjoying prices rises.<br/>
         <br/>
Nickel tops the list. It has been the best-performing commodity this year – soaring 56 per cent until a temporary correction in May – after Indonesia, the world's biggest producer, banned exports of raw material in January. Stiles says Asian investors looking to secure supply are particularly interested in acquiring Australian companies. ''Generally nickel is a good sector, copper, even bauxite,'' she says.<br/>
         <br/>
Credit Suisse analyst Hasan Tevfik says Panoramic Resources, Sirius Resources and Western Areas are the most likely takeover targets given the renewed interest in nickel. He also tips Alumina to go on the block, with its partner US aluminium giant Alcoa its most likely acquirer.<br/>
         <br/>
A domino effect is expected to start rolling through the retail sector after Woolworths South Africa launched a $2.2 billion take­over of Australia's second biggest department store, David Jones.<br/>
         <br/>
Tevfik expects the upmarket retailer's rival, Myer, to generate interest among international players, as it trades at a 40-to-50 per cent discount to the global sector average.<br/>
         <br/>
Browning expects more mergers and acquisitions among retailers, and not just the bigger companies. ''As consumer spending strengthens, that will encourage transaction activity among the speciality retailers.<br/>
         <br/>
''There will be more opportunity for IPOs, for example. I saw speculation this morning that Smiggle could be a spinout from Just Group. I don't know whether that will occur but that's the type of transaction that's more likely in this stage of the cycle.''<br/>
         <br/>
He said renewed interest in the sector was typical after a significant takeover bid, such as Woolworths SA's offer for David Jones.<br/>
         <br/>
Food and beverage<br/>
         <br/>
As the world's population explodes, so does the need for food security. Global players are jostling to position themselves for a baby boom like no other.<br/>
         <br/>
The Earth's population is expected to rise by 1 billion people in the next 11 years, according to the United Nations. But that's not the only thing that is set to increase.<br/>
         <br/>
A rapidly expanding middle class in China – which is demanding a higher-­quality, more Western-style diet – has thrust Australian food processors into the spotlight, says Tony Pittito, Grant Thornton's national head of food and beverage. A flurry of merger-and-acquisition activity has erupted in the sector. Treasury Wine Estate, makers of Penfolds, has rejected a $3 billion private equity bid from US private equity giant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, and Australia's biggest breadmaker,Goodman Fielder, is the target of a $1.37 billion offer from a Singapore-Hong Kong consortium.<br/>
         <br/>
Meanwhile, Australian private equity outfit Pacific Equity Partners has offloaded Peters Ice Cream for what is believed to be more than $400 million to Europe's second-biggest ice-cream maker R&amp;R.<br/>
         <br/>
''We think it will continue in food and ­beverage,'' Pittito says. ''Why? First, access into Asia is very important for these global players, and second, Australian food and beverage companies are clearly seen as being high quality and have a very good reputation." Also vital is food security, in being able to shore up supply. ''The other reason is companies are looking for export growth. Acquisitions into Australian companies help because it gives a foot print into Asia.''<br/>
         <br/>
Pittito says Australian companies are generally cheaper on a price-to-earnings basis compared with their international peers, adding to their takeover appeal.<br/>
         <br/>
''The Australian dollar is very strong and if it were to slip, then this activity would increase further.''<br/>
         <br/>
Ideal targets are companies that have strong brands and the potential to leverage those brands into Asia. ''If you look at the Goodman Fielders, the Warrnambool Cheese and Butters, the Peters, they are all products that have good growth opportunities into Asian markets, Treasury Wine Estates is another one.<br/>
         <br/>
''The key takeaway for Australian companies is this activity is going to continue and they need to be getting their house in order, planning for it, and make sure they are maximising their value so if they're subject to a takeover, they can maximise that value.''<br/>
         <br/>
Agribusiness<br/>
         <br/>
Like food and beverage, agribusinesses are vital to feeding the world's surging population. But PAC partners agribusiness analyst Paul Jensz expects M&amp;A activity to be different from other sectors. He predicts more strategic partnerships among agricultural businesses than outright takeovers.<br/>
         <br/>
This is despite a three-way global bidding war for Warrnambool Cheese and Butter, which made it the world's most expensive dairy company on a price-earnings multiple.<br/>
         <br/>
But that transaction also saw Bega and Fonterra strengthen their alliance, with Fonterra taking a 10 per cent stake in the company, and that followed Japanese-based Sumitomo Chemical Company buying 20 per cent of Australian agriculture chemicals supplier Nufarm in 2011 in a deal designed to share distribution, development, product formulation and logistics.<br/>
         <br/>
''I think all the easy M&amp;As have been done,'' Jensz says. ''There's a case for spreading the management expertise from some other companies, and this, I suppose, is the start of M&amp;A activity.<br/>
         <br/>
''It's a matter for long-term investors and corporates forming a relationship with the Begas, the Select Harvests of the world. It's similar to what Nufarm and Sumitomo have done. M&amp;A would be more of finding the right dancing partner, investing together, maybe trading assets between partners and over time getting to know each other and working out if you can get together and make a lot of money.<br/>
         <br/>
Jensz said these sort of partnerships would limit the losses that some internationals have had investing in Australia.<br/>
         <br/>
''Buying something is expensive and investing money in logistics and processing is pretty big bucks as well. You want to be sure that you're on the right team.<br/>
         <br/>
''It's pretty aggressive going in and buying something. It's mergers and acquisitions. The first one is merger, trying to do something together.''<br/>
         <br/>
Still, Tevfik expects some deals within the sector. He wouldn't be surprised if Sumitomo completely acquires Nufarm, and supermarket-to-coal conglomerate Wesfarmers takes over fertiliser company Incitec Pivot, saying it's a ''good strategic fit''.<br/>
         <br/>
The Abbott government has given its strongest indication yet that it will relax restrictions on media ownership, paving the way for more consolidation of the industry.<br/>
         <br/>
In March, Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull questioned why the country needs specific ownership rules for print, television and radio, given the surge in competition from the internet.<br/>
         <br/>
Media reforms would allow a potential takeover of Ten by News Corporation, which has strong links with the network. Lachlan Murdoch, Ten's former chairman, is now co-chairman of News Corp with his father Rupert.<br/>
         <br/>
The changes could also allow Fairfax Media, owner of The Australian Financial Review, The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, to join forces with a television partner such as Channel Nine or Seven.<br/>
         <br/>
Also under scrutiny is the 75 per cent reach rule. This restricts television networks from broadcasting to less than 75 per cent of the Australian population. Analysts at JPMorgan say the scrapping of the reach rules could make takeover targets of regional TV networks Prime Media, which broadcasts Seven content in regional areas, and Southern Cross Media, which broadcasts Ten content. The privately held WIN Television broadcasts Nine content.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">The Wesfarmers-owned Coles supermarket and liquor group has received approaches from private equity buyers wanting to buy the Vintage Cellars ­liquor chain for up to $300 million.<br/>
         <br/>It is understood the approaches have been made in the past few days and involve splitting off the Vintage Cellars chain in a clean sale out of the larger Coles liquor division.<br/>
         <br/>
Vintage Cellars operates 77 stores around Australia and has been battling to make headway with its smaller footprint stores in a highly competitive market, increasingly dominated by superstores such as rival Dan Murphy's, owned by Woolworths.<br/>
         <br/>
Coles does not separate the financial performance of its individual liquor retailing brands. Industry sources suggested annual sales at Vintage Cellars are currently around $250 million and that it makes profits of between $15 million and $20 million.<br/>
         <br/>
But it has been weighed down by onerous head office costs that have crimped its performance.<br/>
         <br/>
The approaches have been made by at least two different parties as part of deals involving Coles' underperforming liquor division and are centred on a spinoff of Vintage Cellars.<br/>
         <br/>
A Coles spokesman said on Thursday: "We don't comment on media or market speculation around mergers, acquisitions or divestments."<br/>
         <br/>
New South Wales provides a large chunk of the sales revenue of Vintage Cellars; 35 of the stores are in that state.<br/>
         <br/>
There are 15 stores in Victoria and 12 in Western Australia, nine in Queensland and four in South Australia, with one each in the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory.<br/>
         <br/>
Vintage Cellars has struggled to lift its performance in the past few years, and operates at the upper end of the market.Major overhaul<br/>
         <br/>
Speculation has intensified about major changes at the Coles liquor ­division after John Durkan, who will officially take over as managing ­director of Coles supermarkets and ­liquor on July 1, signalled last week there would be a major overhaul of the liquor business.<br/>
         <br/>
It is understood internal structural changes were made inside the broader Coles liquor operations around six to eight weeks ago, which in practical terms separated Vintage Cellars from its stablemates Liquorland and the 1st Choice Liquor Superstore brand, and made it more autonomous.<br/>
         <br/>
Speculation has been bubbling in the liquor trade in the past 48 hours about the possibility of a sale of Vintage Cellars, and the prospect of a future public float of the business.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Durkan, currently chief operating officer of Coles, signalled last week at a Wesfarmers strategy briefing there would be a comprehensive review of the entire Coles liquor business and its performance was ­unacceptable.<br/>
         <br/>
He was blunt in his assessment of the performance of the Coles liquor retailing portfolio, at the briefing on May 28 .<br/>
         <br/>
"The returns, quite frankly, have been unacceptable, and we've got a lot of work to do,'' Mr Durkan told investors. He also said on that day in a specific reference to Vintage Cellars that "we actually see a really good business in Vintage Cellars''.<br/>
         <br/>
He foreshadowed a major overhaul of the liquor operations and a focus on liquor outlets located adjacent to Coles supermarkets.<br/>
         <br/>
Liquor sales make up about 10 per cent of Coles' total profits. Wesfarmers has been concentrating on the turnaround of its supermarkets business since paying $19 billion for the Coles Group in late 2007 in a takeover. The supermarkets business has delivered an impressive turnaround under Ian McLeod.<br/>
         <br/>
But Coles has been unable to produce the same performance in liquor, where the first-mover advantage of Woolworths' Dan Murphy's has made the gap hard to bridge.Fresh look<br/>
         <br/>
Coles hired former prime ­minister Kevin Rudd's economic adviser Andrew Charlton to become general manager of Coles liquor in 2012.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Durkan's review of the ­liquor business will include a fresh look at all the executives in charge of the various Coles ­operations.<br/>
         <br/>
Woolworths' general manager of the Dan Murphy's business, Martin Smith, signalled earlier this week that he intended to open between 10 and 12 stores annually for at least the next six years, which would take the chain up to about 250 stores.<br/>
         <br/>
The private equity interest in the Vintage Cellars business comes just weeks after US-based giant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts launched a $3.05 billion proposal to buy out the struggling Treasury Wine Estates. The deal has been firmly rejected by the owner of Penfolds and Rosemount.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts is understood to have made one of the conditions of its $3.05 billion takeover proposal for Treasury Wine Estates that the wine company hit a full-year profit forecast range, putting extra pressure on the owner of Penfolds and Rosemount.<br/>
         <br/>One of the previously undisclosed conditions of the buyout proposal from the United States private equity firm is that the $4.70 cash offer is prefaced on Treasury reaching the full-year earnings range of between $190 million and $210 million for 2013-14.<br/>
         <br/>
The earnings hurdle puts extra ­pressure on the Treasury board and new chief executive Mike Clarke to ­generate solid profits in the vital last few weeks of June.<br/>
         <br/>
A Treasury spokesman declined to comment on Tuesday, except to say that "the proposal was submitted in con­fidence and we intend to preserve that confidentiality".<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury shares continue to trade well above the $5 mark and closed on Tuesday at $5.14, down 6¢ for the day.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Clarke has been urging Treasury staff internally to stay focused on ­delivering a strong sales performance in the final weeks of June and not to be ­distracted by the KKR proposal.<br/>
         <br/>
But the prospect of KKR with­drawing its $4.70 cash offer if Treasury misses its earnings guidance is hanging over the company in a difficult ­marketplace.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury and KKR continue to be locked in a stalemate, with Treasury refusing to grant access to KKR to undertake a due diligence process inside the company.<br/>
         <br/>
The Treasury board's stance has not changed since May 20 when it first publicly disclosed the KKR ­proposal and rejected it on the basis that it did not reflect the "fundamental value" of the company.<br/>
         <br/>
The Treasury board did not divulge what it regarded as a high enough price for it to let KKR in to conduct due diligence.<br/>
         <br/>
The original proposal by KKR went to Treasury on April 16 but was only publicly disclosed to the ­market on May 20.<br/>
         <br/>
On May 20 Mr Clarke, who started as chief executive in late March, also outlined that he would aggressively pursue $35 million in savings, axe 175 jobs from the 3500-strong workforce and bump up investment in the company's wine brands by 50 per cent.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Clarke also vowed not to chase short-term profits as he outlined there were difficult conditions in a highly competitive market, re-affirming at that point that Treasury's expectation was that it would still reach its ­previously stated forecast.<br/>
         <br/>
That forecast, of an earnings before interest, tax and the SGARA accounting standard, was for a guidance range of $190 million to $210 million, and had been made months earlier after a profit downgrade caused by poor trading ­performance in December as the group refused to be part of aggressive pro­motional discounts with major ­liquor chains.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Clarke said on May 20 that "we will not engage in short-term ­practices to the detriment of our long-term objectives".<br/>
         <br/>
Interestingly, in a different sector, the standards and compliances firm SAI Global has begun an auction process, opening up a data room to all cred­ible bidders a week after it disclosed that it had received a $1.1 billion buyout proposal from Pacific Equity Partners.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury has more than 73,000 shareholders, and chairman Paul Rayner sent a letter to shareholders more than a week ago outlining the ­reasons why the company had rejected the proposal.<br/>
         <br/>
But Mr Rayner also said Treasury would carefully consider proposals that did provide proper compensation for the value of the company.<br/>
         <br/>
Most fund managers believe that for the Treasury board to engage it would require an offer well above the $5 mark.<br/>
         <br/>
The large volumes of high-quality red wine under the Penfolds brand, that are currently sitting in inventory and due to hit the market over the next two to three years, are considered the main prize for any buyer of the company.<br/>
         <br/>
Those red wine stocks are projected to substantially accelerate earnings at Treasury in 2015-16.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Record low interest rates have prompted cashed-up private equity firms to open their wallets again and circle cheap Australian companies.<br/>
         <br/>Monday's $1.1 billion bid for SAI ­Global from private equity firm Pacific Equity Partners has continued a rush of merger and acquisition activity. According to Dealogic, M&amp;A entry deals are up from $3.01 billion in 2013 to $6.16 billion so far this year, while M&amp;A exit deals total $1.13 billion. Equity capital markets activity, such as floats, are just short of $2 billion in 2014.<br/>
         <br/>
So why has the private equity industry thundered back into action, having stuck mainly to the sidelines since 2012?<br/>
         <br/>
David Buckland, chief executive of fund manager Montgomery Investment Management, attributed the offloading to a buoyant market. He said private equity firms aimed to time parting with an asset when they could make more money from an initial public offering as opposed to selling to a trade buyer. "They obviously want to do it when the market can take these floats comfortably and that's the case at the moment," Mr Buckland said.<br/>
         <br/>
On the buy side, record low interest rates had spurred takeover interest, considering private equity firms normally "aggressively geared" acquisitions, Mr Buckland said. He said there were also perceived bargains in the market, describing United States private equity giant KKR &amp; Co's $3.1 billion bid for Treasury Wine Estates , which owns Penfolds, as "opportunistic".<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury thought so too. Although the bid of $4.70 a share was a premium of 27 per cent to where the company traded on April 15, Treasury said in a statement to the ASX that "the proposal does not reflect the fundamental value of the company".<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Buckland said private equity firms would circle companies with ­reliable cash flows, given their high gearing, as well as businesses with substantial market share. He tipped the industrial sector would be a target.<br/>
         <br/>
Yasser El-Ansary, CEO of Australian Private Equity and Venture Capital Association, said the health and aged-care sectors were also being watched.<br/>
         <br/>
On Monday, private equity firm Ironbridge launched the IPO of fertility business Monash IVF Group, with a capital raising of between $267 million and $298 million. "As our population ages and the need for services increases, I think the level of interest in that part of the economy has moved in tandem," Mr El-Ansary said.<br/>
         <br/>
"The more private-sector capital that can be channelled into healthcare the better, because the government will not be able to sustain the entire system on its own. It will be very dependent on the role of the private sector in bringing capital and to carry some of the load," he added.<br/>
         <br/>
Blue Sky Private Equity's managing director, Tim Wilson, agreed that the health and aged-care sectors were the go-to for private equity firms.<br/>
         <br/>
"We've made an investment into a retirement village and we're looking at others in the care space, in early care and aged care. Those segments are performing well," he said.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Wilson said a selling window had opened which relieved pressure from the past five years and that explained the abundance of exit stories for private equity firms. "It's fair to say that right through the last five years there's been a growing pressure from investors to get capital returns," he said.<br/>
         <br/>
"Once money starts returning to investors, when there are good returns confidence builds in the private equity sector. Capital starts getting invested. We might have been sitting there longer than we wanted to, but the returns are now coming."<br/>
         <br/>
Wolseley Private Equity's managing director, James Todd, who focuses on companies valued between $30 million and $120 million, is noticing more opportunities, partly due to less-captive private equity teams being operated by large banks and insurance companies.<br/>
         <br/>
"As equity markets have increased over the past 12 months that has led a range of business owners thinking about the future ownership positions of their companies and has provided the interest," he said.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Treasury Wine Estates chief executive Mike Clarke will start swinging the axe within the nation's biggest winemaker on Monday as 5 per cent of the workforce is culled in the first phase of an earnings turnaround plan.<br/>
         <br/>The Penfolds, Rosemount and Wolf Blass winemaker is expected to make deep cuts in its middle ­management ranks and also to trim travel expenses, office space and ­production facilities.<br/>
         <br/>
The crackdown on discretionary spending inside the company, including slashing the use of consultants, comes as Treasury closely scrutinises some of its lesser-known brands.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Clarke and a group of senior executives are preparing to whittle down its 83-strong portfolio, which has been built up over 15 years of acquisitions.<br/>
         <br/>
While no decisions have been made, it is understood that brands including Tollana, Metala, Robertson's Well and Ingoldby are among those ­second-tier brands that are being looked at closely.<br/>
         <br/>
It has also emerged that Bank of America Merrill Lynch is one of the key players in a syndicate of banks that are part of the financing package which Kohlberg Kravis Roberts has signed off on.<br/>
         <br/>
But BAML has stipulated that it is subject to KKR doing full due ­diligence with complete access to Treasury's books.<br/>
         <br/>
This makes it highly unlikely that KKR would contemplate a hostile bid.<br/>
         <br/>
KKR has been attempting to get access to Treasury's books since its ­initial $3.05 billion takeover approach on April 16, but has been unsuccessful.<br/>
         <br/>
One wine industry executive said Mr Clarke would easily be able to make the job cuts – representing roughly 175 jobs – because Treasury had grown too large in recent years on the expectation that demand for its wines would rise.<br/>
         <br/>
"They're still selling a lot of cheaper wine, which you could argue they shouldn't be in any more," the source said.<br/>
         <br/>
"I don't believe for a second that KKR is buying it to manage a turnaround. It has to be a break-up. I think they've probably got people lined up for some of the assets."<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury says KKR's $4.70 cash-per- share, highly conditional offer undervalues the company.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury's firm stance has shifted focus to whether a rival bid may emerge.<br/>
         <br/>
Chinese food giant Bright Food, ­speculated as a potential bidder, said on Friday it had not held internal ­discussions about a potential bid.<br/>
         <br/>
But Bright, which was believed to be eyeing Treasury in 2011, has been aggressively expanding across the globe.<br/>
         <br/>
Last week it agreed to pay British ­private equity firm Apax nearly $1 billion for a 56 per cent stake in Israel's largest dairy manufacturer, Tnuva.<br/>
         <br/>
Bright bought a 60 per cent slice of Britain's Weetabix in 2012 and is well known in Australia.<br/>
         <br/>
It has recently bought dairy group Mundella and in 2011 bought a 75 per cent stake in Manassen Foods.<br/>
         <br/>
Its adviser on the Manassen deal was Nomura, which is advising KKR on its Treasury bid.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury's shares have surged 40 per cent since April 16. The rally is opportune for some of Treasury's largest shareholders. Commonwealth Bank's Colonial First State lifted its holding from 7.6 per cent to 9.1 per cent a fortnight before KKR made its approach to Treasury. Wellington increased its stake from 5.7 per cent to 6.8 per cent in February.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">CEO Mike Clarke has rejected KKR's takeover bid. But how does he convince short-term investors it's worth hanging on, asks Simon Evans.<br/>
         <br/>The grapes from Adrian Hoffmann's gnarled 100-year-old shiraz vines in the northern Barossa Valley were once a regular part of the precious annual supply for Australia's most famous wine, Penfolds Grange.<br/>
         <br/>
But in 2007, Hoffman, a sixth-generation vigneron with 120 hectares of some of the oldest vineyards in the Barossa, decided he didn't want to be enmeshed in a large corporate machine. There was more appreciation and warm inner glow from selling the grapes to prestigious but much smaller, family-owned Barossa wine producers such as Rockford Wines, Two Hands Wines and Glaetzer Wines, which he believes are more patient about the in­evitable ups and downs of the wine industry.<br/>
         <br/>
Hoffman is bemused but not surprised by the latest corporate machinations surrounding the Penfolds brand and its stablemates, including Wolf Blass, Wynns and Rosemount. The parent company of those famous wine brands, Treasury Wine Estates, received a $3.05 billion buyout proposal on Tuesday from New York-based private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. If it is successful, KKR will become the seventh corporate owner of Penfolds since 1976.<br/>
         <br/>
Penfolds, with its flagship Grange retailing this year for $785 a bottle, remains robust and a strong performer despite the head-spinning changes in the entities controlling the purse strings, as it passed from one set of owners to the next. One aspect that has suitors salivating this time is that, while Treasury's overall financial performance has been disappointing owing to some poor management decisions and operational controls, there's up to $280 million of higher-quality red wines sitting in barrel halls due to come on the market over the next two years.<br/>
         <br/>
KKR, a global pioneer of leveraged buyouts, was the focus of the lively book Barbarians at the Gate, which documented the $25 billion takeover of biscuit maker Nabisco in the United States in the late 1980s. This time it's Penfolds they're after. Analysts estimate the famous label makes about $180 million in profits annually, which equates to about 75 per cent of Treasury's total profits. The Penfolds profits alone could rise to at least $350 million annually in 2015-16, according to Bank of America ­Merrill Lynch, because of the higher levels of luxury wines waiting to be wheeled out.<br/>
         <br/>
Hoffman is glad to be away from the ­bigger conglomerates, and regards the latest deal-making as a cautionary tale in an industry notoriously difficult to consistently make money from.Volatile corporate sector<br/>
         <br/>
"I saw the corporate sector as a little bit volatile,'' Hoffman says. He bears no malice towards Treasury or Penfolds' previous owners Foster's Group and Southcorp, for whom he also supplied for years.<br/>
         <br/>
The volatility of the industry is underlined when Hoffman recalls that in the mid-1980s the precious family holdings now known as Dimchurch vineyards were put up for sale in lean times.<br/>
         <br/>
This was at a time of a government-­sponsored vine-pull scheme to eradicate a surplus of grapes across the industry, but the family didn't qualify for the incentives on offer. There were no buyers. That was a ­godsend. Hoffman still marvels at the quality of the grapes from the old vines when weather conditions are right. "Nothing can touch them."<br/>
         <br/>
This year was a tough one, with frosts in October last year cutting his output from the 2014 grape ­harvest by 60 per cent. That is part of the cyclical nature of the industry, and Hoffman accepts it is sometimes a hard slog.<br/>
         <br/>
Mike Clarke, the fledgling chief executive of Treasury, also faces an uphill battle. He was headhunted by the beleaguered board after running British food company Premier Foods, which makes products including Bisto gravy and Mr Kipling cakes. His first official day on the job was March 31. He outlined a broad five-year plan just over a week later, warning that Treasury had way too many brands, with a bulging portfolio of 83. But then on April 16 a sick feeling welled up in his stomach. KKR, which is being advised by Nomura investment banker John Hanson, made a confidential buyout proposal to the company of $4.70 cash a share. It wasn't revealed publicly until May 20.<br/>
         <br/>
KKR made it clear it wanted full access to the internal books so it could do proper due diligence before proceeding. Treasury won't let it in and argues the company is worth more, but won't quantify how much. Well-connected Goldman Sachs investment banker Christian Johnston, a long-time adviser to Treasury and its former parent Foster's Group, is in the trenches with the Treasury board.<br/>
         <br/>
There are also question marks about whether Treasury should have let the ­market know immediately it received the proposal.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury announced it to the ASX on May 20, only after KKR, frustrated by Treasury's intransigence, had started talking directly to its bigger institutional shareholders about the proposal.<br/>
         <br/>
KKR is no stranger to Clarke. After he left Premier Foods in mid-2013 he remained in the northern hemisphere and helped KKR as an adviser when it wanted some fast-moving consumer goods expertise. At the time, the raider was mulling over making a potential offer for the nutritional drinks brands Lucozade and Ribena. Sinking morale<br/>
         <br/>
Clarke has his hands full keeping up morale inside Treasury. As part of a $35 million cost-cutting plan revealed on Tuesday (at the same time as he revealed the KKR bid), he will slice out 175 jobs from the corporate head office in Melbourne and other areas. Straight out of the corporate play book, Clarke shot an email to Treasury's 3500 staff, acknowledging the proposal "may be unsettling" but urging them to concentrate on delivering solid performance over the five weeks leading up to June 30 "in the strongest possible way".<br/>
         <br/>
Morale has been sinking since ­Treasury endured derision in mid-2013 when it revealed it would need to destroy six million bottles of under-$10 wine in the US, after being caught with too much stock in the warehouses of third-party distributors.<br/>
         <br/>
Why is it that Penfolds has had so many corporate owners? A broader look at the wine industry shows the model of wine companies being listed on the stock exchange in Australia, which held so much promise in the late 1990s as a means of accessing capital, has largely not worked.<br/>
         <br/>
In the late 1990s and early 2000s almost 20 different wine companies and wine investment funds were listed on the ASX. In the six years leading up to 2005 most of them disappeared through takeover, frustration from investors over poor returns, or obliteration through financial collapse.<br/>
         <br/>
Fund managers demand strong short-term performance to be delivered without fail every six months when results are released. But it is a difficult task in the wine industry where there is significant capital tied up in wine maturing in barrels in the case of higher quality red wine, and processing infrastructure at wineries is only used for three months of each year during the vintage overlaid with the volatility of being an ­agricultural industry.<br/>
         <br/>
Robert Hill Smith, the managing director of family-owned Yalumba Wines, has argued passionately for years that "patient capital" is needed over decades to ride the agricultural cycles, and that is in short supply in publicly listed companies.<br/>
         <br/>
The string of listed wine companies that emerged onto the ASX 10 to 15 years ago came during a strong growth phase for the industry, super-charged by a low Australian dollar which fuelled strong export sales. There was heavy expansion in vineyard plantings to generate more supply to fill the bottles, but his went too far.Consistent return needed<br/>
         <br/>
Industry dynamics were brought undone by a raft of tax-driven managed investment schemes that triggered a rapid surge in vineyard areas in Australia, from 78,000 hectares in 1998 to 143,000 in 2003. More broadly, a global grape oversupply late in the decade caused havoc.<br/>
         <br/>
KKR thinks Clarke has the right plans to fix the Treasury business, but argues it needs to be taken away from the spotlight of the public markets and spend at least five years in private hands. In this way, reinvestment in brands will have time to work and cost-­cutting will flow through to deliver a more consistent and sustainable return on capital.<br/>
         <br/>
Clarke is a huge fan of the Penfolds brand and refers to it as one of the brands "that we haven't mucked up in the past", but is frustrated at the lack of investment in brand marketing for most of the other sleepers such as Wynns.<br/>
         <br/>
So, from 1976 and NSW brewer Tooth &amp; Co through to the 1980s corporate raider John Spalvins and his Adelaide Steamship Company, through to SA Brewing, then Southcorp, then Foster's Group and then as the standalone Treasury, Penfolds has been on a rollercoaster ride.<br/>
         <br/>
Whether KKR will get the opportunity to perform corporate surgery on Treasury and become the new owner depends on the mood of big investment funds, which may be growing tired of fluctuating fortunes and the long lead times of good wine and instead take the money and run.<br/>

              <div class="document-view__body">Treasury Wine Estates says it has the support of the majority of its largest shareholders over its handling of a $3.05 billion takeover approach by private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.<br/>
         <br/>It comes as some investors hit out at a month-long delay in revealing the bid and called on Treasury to engage in ­discussions with KKR and extract a higher offer. "If someone has put a price on the table, a limited due ­diligence is not out of the question," one ­shareholder said.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury waited 33 days before telling the market on Tuesday that it had received an indicative, non-binding offer from KKR. It said it informed the market after the private equity giant began secretly approaching shareholders about its offer, a move Treasury believed created a risk that confidentiality had been lost.<br/>
         <br/>
KKR became frustrated at a lack of cooperation from Treasury on an initial $4.70 cash per share proposal and while it approached some Treasury shareholders it maintains "appropriate confidentiality protocols" were in place.<br/>
         <br/>
A Treasury shareholder and senior institutional fund manager lashed out at Treasury's disclosure. "If you get a genuine approach from a credible place with a price attached to it, my reading of the listing rules is you should disclose that," the fund manager said.<br/>
         <br/>
"Juxtapose it to their position, and their actual disclosure, saying they were not talking to Pernod Ricard or they were not talking to Constellation. It's ludicrous. The whole time they knew about the KKR approach."<br/>
         <br/>
KRR's offer has put Treasury in play but China's Bright Food Group ­distanced itself from speculation it was eyeing the Penfolds and Wolf Blass wine­maker. A spokesman told Bloomberg Bright Foods had not had internal discussions about whether to bid for the winemaker.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury maintains it has not breached disclosure rules because KKR's offer was incomplete and ­confidential. Treasury chairman Paul Rayner declined to comment on Friday but a Treasury spokesman said the company had been in discussions with the majority of its largest shareholders and had their support. "They fully ­support our position on how and why the market was informed," the ­spokesman said.<br/>
         <br/>
The board would seriously consider any offer put forward to the company, and if those proposals "represent fair value", Treasury "would be prepared to open the books to due diligence", he said. A number of shareholders and analysts believe KKR needs to pay more than $5 a share to win the company.<br/>
         <br/>
Another fund manager earlier this week said it was "pretty poor" Treasury failed to disclose the bid when it was first made. "If you get approached with the stock at $3.70, I would say that was a material bid," the fund manager said.<br/>

              <div class="document-view__body">Shares advanced for the third week in a row as a flurry of corporate deal activity and initial public offerings helped the market rally from a 1.3 per cent fall at the start of the week following a slump in the iron ore price.<br/>
         <br/>The S&amp;P/ASX 200 Index added 0.3 per cent over the week to close at 5492 points, while the broader All Ordinaries Index gained 0.2 per cent to 5470.3, as investors shrugged off worries about slower demand growth from China and questions lingered about whether the sustained bull run remains justified.<br/>
         <br/>
"Growth prospects for Australian corporate earnings are improving and are supportive of current market val­uations," Alphinity Investment Management portfolio manager Johan Carlberg said.<br/>
         <br/>
On Friday, the benchmark index added 0.2 per cent, with a solid debut from the biggest initial public offering to hit the boards in 2014. Maintenance and catering services company Spotless Group Holdings lifted 7.2 per cent to $1.72. Intueri Education Group rose 8.7 per cent on its IPO to $2.37.<br/>
         <br/>
"There has been an avalanche of new offers to consider in recent months but, as usual, the quality has been mixed, with some priced too high," said Quest Asset Partners director and portfolio manager, Michael Evans.<br/>
         <br/>
Telecommunications was the best-performing sector over the week, as Telstra Corporation advanced 5.38 per cent to a nine-year high of $5.38.<br/>
         <br/>
Three of the big four banks pushed higher. Commonwealth Bank of Australia rose 1.1 per cent to $81.31, National Australia Bank added 0.3 per cent to $33.57, and ANZ Banking Group lifted 2 per cent to $33.60. Westpac Banking Corporation fell 0.3 per cent to $34.19.<br/>

"Looking ahead, investors need to be mindful of where we are in the banks' earnings cycle," Mr Carlberg said.<br/>

Resources giant BHP Billiton lost 1.1 per cent to $37.65, while main rival Rio Tinto shed 1.2 per cent to $60.54.<br/>
         <br/>
Junior goldminer Regis Resources was the worst-performing stock, dumping 25 per cent on Friday after an operations update and revision to 2015 guidance disappointed analysts.<br/>
         <br/>
Energy stocks were mostly lower as China and Russia announced a major gas deal. Woodside Petroleum fell 0.3 per cent to $41.61 after abandoning an Israeli joint venture, leaving investors uncertain about how it plans to use the allocated capital.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury Wine Estates, owner of Penfolds, was the best-performing stock, climbing 26.72 per cent to $5.17 after the company revealed it rejected a takeover bid from private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts last month.<br/>
         <br/>

              <div class="document-view__body">Private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts intends keeping Treasury Wine Estates chief executive Mike Clarke at the helm should its $3.05 billion offer prove successful, but they believe the company needs to be away from the glare of public markets for Mr Clarke's long-term fix-it plans to succeed.<br/>
         <br/>It comes as Treasury's board met on Thursday for day two of a scheduled two-day board meeting. Mr Clarke has been urging staff internally not to be distracted and to focus on delivering solid sales over the next five weeks leading to June 30.<br/>
         <br/>
KKR has a team of up to 10 experts on standby should it be granted access to Treasury's books to do a thorough due diligence, but Treasury won't allow that to happen. Treasury's own assessment of value is higher than the $4.70 a share cash offer from KKR.<br/>
         <br/>
KKR has made it clear to Mr Clarke that they think he is the right man for the job. But they are adamant that for Treasury's problems of under-investment in brands and high costs in non-productive parts of the business to be fixed, it will need at least five years away from being a publicly listed company to engineer ­sustainable improvements.<br/>
         <br/>
A source close to KKR said Mr Clarke was highly respected and had a good track record. They think his strategy is sound but are concerned about a short-term earnings hit as the inevitable tough measures take time to work through. A privatisation is the answer, they believe.Strong links<br/>
         <br/>
KKR already has strong links with Mr Clarke. He was used as a food and beverages expert adviser by KKR in mid-2013 when it was crunching the numbers on a potential buyout of the nutritional drinks brands Lucozade and Ribena, which at that point had been put up for sale by pharmaceuticals giant GlaxoSmithKline. Japanese giant Suntory eventually bought the two brands for £1.35 billion ($2.47 billion) in a process which also attracted interest from private equity firms including Blackstone and Lion Capital.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Clarke worked as an adviser on several different private equity deals in the northern hemisphere after he left his role as chief executive of British food group Premier Foods in mid-2013.<br/>

He started at Treasury, which owns brands including Penfolds and Wolf Blass, on March 31 this year. On April 8 he outlined his own five-year fix-it plan, including culling some of the company's 83 brands and lifting marketing spending. KKR's $4.70 a share cash proposal was made in secret to Treasury on April 16, but that wasn't made public until May 20. Mr Clarke on that day outlined $35 million in cost-cutting and a step-up in investment in brands of up to 50 per cent.<br/>

Treasury shares softened slightly on Thursday for the first time since the offer became public, after hitting a seven-month high on Wednesday.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">A continued rally in Telstra, a warm reception to Woodside Petroleum's decision to pull the plug on an Israeli joint venture, and international interest in beleaguered Treasury Wine Estates saw the sharemarket inch higher on Wednesday.<br/>
         <br/>The index recovered from early losses, sparked by another drop in the iron ore price and a slump in consumer confidence.<br/>
         <br/>
The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX 200 Index edged up 4.2 points, or a bit less than 0.1 per cent, to 5419.7, while the broader All Ordinaries Index added 2.2 points to 5403.9.<br/>
         <br/>
Local shares took a weak lead form offshore after major markets in the United States and Europe finished lower on Tuesday night. Asian ­sharemarkets were mixed in the ­afternoon session.<br/>
         <br/>
Domestically, investor sentiment was subdued amid further evidence consumer confidence is at a more than 2½-year low. The monthly Westpac/Melbourne Institute index of sentiment slumped 6.8 per cent to 92.9 points in May from 99.7 in April.<br/>
         <br/>
"The sharp fall is clearly indicating an unfavourable response to the recent federal budget," Westpac chief ­economist Bill Evans said.<br/>
         <br/>
Meanwhile, Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed wages grew 0.7 per cent over the March quarter. Wages are up 2.6 per cent over the past 12 months.<br/>
         <br/>
The big four banks were mixed. Westpac Banking Corporation edged down 1¢ to $33.67, and National ­Australia Bank fell 0.2 per cent to $33.05. Commonwealth Bank of ­Australia added 0.5 per cent to $80.19, while ANZ Banking Group lifted 0.9 per cent to $33.03.Miners take a tumble<br/>
         <br/>
Mining stocks tumbled as the spot price for iron ore, landed in China, slipped another 1 per cent to $US97.50 per tonne – its lowest price since ­September 2012.<br/>
         <br/>
The country's biggest producer of iron ore, Rio Tinto, lost 1.1 per cent to a near nine-month low of $59.40. Resources giant BHP Billiton shed 0.8 per cent to $37.17, while the third-largest local iron ore miner Fortescue Metals Group fell 2.4 per cent to $4.43.<br/>
         <br/>
With Rio Tinto trading under $60 for the first time this year, some stock­brokers were expecting increased interest in the big miners from retail investors in early trading on Thursday. But Pengana Global Resources Fund portfolio manager Ric Ronge said he was wary of earnings downgrades from Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton as the iron ore price continues to slide.<br/>
         <br/>
Woodside Petroleum, lifted 0.8 per cent to $41.23 with investors now expecting a capital return after the company terminated its agreement to take a stake in a $US2.7 billion ($2.9 billion) natural gas project in Israel.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury Wine Estates was the best-performing stock in the ASX 200 as it continued to get a boost from Tuesday's revelation the company rejected a ­private equity takeover bid last month with $US125 billion Chicago-based investment firm Harris Associates L.P. emerging as a new significant ­shareholder.<br/>
         <br/>
Shares in TWE, owner of Penfolds and Lindemans, added 5.6 per cent to $5.07 – above $5 for the first time since November.<br/>
         <br/>
Telstra Corporation lifted 1.1 per cent to a fresh nine-year high at $5.36 after unveiling a plan on Tuesday to spend $100 million rolling out a nationwide Wi-Fi network to launch in early 2015.<br/>
         <br/>
Credit Suisse analyst Fraser McLeish described it as "a sound strategic move" and reiterated his "buy" recommend­ation and 12-month target price of $5.70</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">No one makes a stock call like Merrill Lynch analyst David "Torso" Errington, so it's a treat to see his bullish price target on (the suddenly alluring) Treasury Wine Estates getting a run.<br/>
         <br/>Torso (so named as we explained last month because of his early 1990s proclivity to place his body on the line when making a call: "I'd bet my left leg. I'd bet my right arm . . . I'd bet my left knacker," he recalled to us), reckons Michael Clarke's Penfolds bottlers could fetch up to $6.60 from a suitor, following US private equity group Kohlberg Kravis Roberts' initial offer.<br/>
         <br/>
But, translating the call into the Torso Index, just how convinced is he? Is this a super confident "left knacker" or more of a pretty confident "right pinky"? Alarmingly, in light of his nickname, Torso didn't answer our calls on Wednesday to enlighten us. Hope he's OK.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">United States private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts has full financing in place for its $3.05 billion buyout offer for Treasury Wine Estates but is pushing for immediate access to the wine group's books because the funding is predicated on it doing due diligence.<br/>
         <br/>But Treasury chief executive Mike Clarke and his fellow directors, who spent Wednesday locked in a board meeting, are refusing to budge on access as they finalise plans to begin cutting 175 staff from Monday in a desperate push to slim down the nation's biggest winemaker, after rejecting a takeover proposal from KKR.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Clarke, a former Kraft and Premier Foods executive, is under pressure to secure support quickly from long-suffering shareholders after it emerged KKR began secretly approaching investors about the merits of its conditional takeover proposal.<br/>
         <br/>
The private equity firm had become frustrated at a lack of cooperation from Treasury on an initial proposal put to the company on April 16.<br/>
         <br/>
It comes as analysts encouraged Treasury to engage with KKR, noting the conditional $4.70 price was much higher than their valuations.<br/>
         <br/>
Credit Suisse says without the takeover proposal, Treasury is worth just $3.15 per share.<br/>
         <br/>
However, a number of analysts and shareholders believe KKR needs to lift the offer price to beyond $5 to secure the group. Merrill Lynch has estimated Treasury could be worth up to $6.50 if its assets were broken up and sold.<br/>
         <br/>
Shares in Treasury, which owns brands including Penfolds, Lindemans and Rosemount, continued to rise on Wednesday, gaining as much as 6 per cent before closing up 5.6 per cent, or 27¢, to $5.07, a seven-month high.<br/>
         <br/>
KKR's corporate advisers Nomura made fresh requests on Wednesday for access to the company's books for a formal due diligence process, but continued to be rebuffed on the basis that the Treasury board believes the company is worth more than $4.70.<br/>
         <br/>
KKR is understood to have its financing in place, subject to due diligence.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury has never been short of interested buyers. Treasury's former owner, Foster's Group, knocked back an approach worth as much as $2.7 billion from Cerebus Capital for the wine business in 2010. It's understood Constellation Brands has also eyed the group's US assets over the years.<br/>
         <br/>
It also emerged KKR's interest in Treasury gathered pace in May 2011 when Treasury split from former parent Foster's Group in a demerger.<br/>
         <br/>
It has been linked to a potential tilt alongside TPG in 2010, when Treasury was part of Foster's.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury, which was virtually debt-free at that time in a deliberate strategy by the Foster's board to give it as much chance of success as possible, traded at $3.45 on its first day as a listed entity. The stock has been as high as $6.47 in May 2013 before a succession of operational stumbles in the US and Australia.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Clarke, who left London to take up the Treasury job on March 31, quickly laid the ground work for hefty cuts, telling the market on April 8 "there is a lot that needs to be fixed" and warned jobs would go. On Tuesday he was forced to bring forward firm details of his plan, including $35 million in savings and boosting marketing spending by up to 50 per cent in a bid to improve consumer demand for its brands.<br/>
         <br/>
The KKR approach could make it more difficult for Mr Clarke to convince shareholders of the merits of sticking around for his five-year journey,especially after enduring a roller coaster ride for the past 15 years as numerous chief executives extolled the virtue of a long-term strategy. Citigroup analyst Gino Rossi, who lifted his target price from $3.80 to $4.70, said Mr Clarke's turnaround strategy looked "sensible and well thought out" but executing it could prove difficult. This meant a higher offer from KKR would be a good alternative for shareholders.<br/>
         <br/>
"Treasury Wine is a complex business and the wine industry remains challenging," Mr Rossi said.<br/>
         <br/>
"Mr Clarke now has the added pressure of the KKR bid, which will mean he is not as free to trade off short-term profits for long-term benefit. When factoring in risk, a KKR bid at a slightly higher price seems a good alternative for shareholders."<br/>
         <br/>
One fund manager scotched suggestions KKR was being opportunistic in its approach by trying to secure Treasury as it desperately tries to achieve bullish earnings guidance.<br/>
         <br/>
"I think they waited until they had a found a buyer in the US for Treasury's assets there," said the fund manager. who did not want to be named. "They could then work for a few years on Penfolds and the Australian business and relist Penfolds or a trade sale."<br/>
         <br/>
It is understood KKR has no immediate plans to carve up Treasury's assets.<br/>
         <br/>
Credit Suisse analyst Larry Gandler lifted his target price to $4.70 a share. In a research note he said the $4.70 proposal "is so far above our $3.15 valuation that we think the board should engage with KKR''.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Poor tasting notes have not dissuaded private equity firm KKR &amp; Co from launching a $3.1 billion offer for Australia's Treasury Wine Estates, one of the world's largest pure-play winemakers. TWE rejected it, and has also recently denied reports that it was in talks to sell its United States business to either Pernod Ricard or Constellation Brands.<br/>
         <br/>But industry consolidation is in the air. Last month, LVMH bought the Clos de Lambrays vineyard in Burgundy and Pernod Ricard bought Kenwood Vineyards in California.<br/>
         <br/>
TWE would be a larger swig than either of those deals. The company has struggled of late. Revenues have grown a fifth since 2010, but costs have risen at double that rate so profits have fallen. TWE has already taken remedial action in the US.<br/>
         <br/>
And new chief executive Michael Clarke plans to improve things further with a 50 per cent increase in consumer marketing spend, to be financed by $35 million of cost cuts.<br/>
         <br/>
The attractions for a buyer lie in two areas. First, restore TWE's margins; second, push its brands, including Lindeman's, Wolf Blass and Penfolds. Half of the company's sales are in Australia and New Zealand, but Euromonitor says this is one of the weakest regions in terms of forecast wine market growth (less than 1 per cent a year over the next four years).<br/>
         <br/>
North America, Latin America and Asia, growing at 2 per cent, 3 per cent and 6 per cent respectively, are where the action is. There are opportunities for anyone with the finance and patience to push the brands hard.<br/>
         <br/>
KKR's $4.7 per share offer gives TWE an enterprise value of 11 times next year's forecast earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Large drinks groups, such as Constellation and Pernod Ricard, are all on 13 to 15 times. Even if KKR fails, other tasters will soon start sniffing around TWE's cellars.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">New Treasury Wine Estates chief executive Mike Clarke will strip out $35 million in costs and axe 175 jobs from the global wine giant that owns brands, including Penfolds and Rosemount, in a desperate push to kick-start growth and save it from falling to private equity predator Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, which has made a $3.05 billion take­over bid for the troubled business.<br/>
         <br/>Mr Clarke, who became Treasury's sixth chief executive in four years after arriving from the United Kingdom just seven weeks ago, is in a race against time as United States-based KKR seeks to capitalise on shareholder discontent with the Treasury board and a string of operational disasters to swoop on Australia's most famous wine brands.<br/>
         <br/>
"We are moving from first gear into fifth gear in this company,'' Mr Clarke said. KKR denied it breached any confidentiality agreements by going direct to some institutional shareholders in Treasury with its $3.05 billion takeover approach, after becoming frustrated at the progress of secret talks.<br/>
         <br/>
It originally delivered the takeover proposal to Treasury on April 16.<br/>
         <br/>
The company said on Tuesday that in the last week its advisers from Nomura held discussions with certain shareholders on "a wall-crossed, confidential basis and subject to appropriate confidentiality protocols''.<br/>
         <br/>
It is believed that KKR is concentrating its efforts on TWE's ffshore institutional investors.<br/>
         <br/>
Earlier on Tuesday, Treasury revealed it received an approach from KKR more than a month ago and had been in secret talks about the offer since then. There had been "engagement'' with KKR but that stopped when Treasury found out that KKR had been talking to institutions about the bid, Mr Clarke said.<br/>
         <br/>
One of the factors that had prevented deep engagement with KKR was Treasury's own heavy restructuring plans.<br/>
         <br/>
"We're doing a shake-up in how this company will be run,'' he said.<br/>
         <br/>
But Treasury only disclosed the approach on Tuesday morning, when it urged shareholders to take no action and also revealed it was taking a knife to costs across the company in an ­aggressive $35 million cost-cutting blitz, while at the same time bumping up spending on its wine brand marketing by 50 per cent.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Clarke said the cost-cutting, which would bring $35 million in savings in 2014-15, would involve scrapping 5 per cent of positions in Treasury's global workforce of 3500.<br/>
         <br/>
The savings would be reinvested in consumer marketing behind the 20 top brands of the 83 inside Treasury's portfolio. Penfolds was the prized asset that needed to be worked harder still, while Wolf Blass and Wynns would also receive more consumer marketing investment.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Clarke said Penfolds was "one of the brands in our portfolio that we haven't mucked up in the past''.<br/>
         <br/>
KKR's bid increases the pressure on Mr Clarke to win support from shareholders for his turnaround plan. He wants shareholders to look past the next six weeks and focus on the next five years, suggesting he is far from confident on delivering fiscal 2014 earnings numbers set for him by previous management and the current board.<br/>
         <br/>
"The longer-term value of our company is not going to be dependent on the next six weeks trading results. That I feel very clear on."<br/>
         <br/>
On April 8, Mr Clarke recommitted the company to achieving earnings of between $190 million and $210 million, which requires more than $145 million to be achieved in the second half, outperforming the previous year.<br/>
         <br/>
The KKR bid is a cash offer priced at $4.70 a share and values the Treasury business at $3.05 billion. Treasury shares jumped almost 20 per cent to beyond the offer price in early trade on Tuesday and by the close had finished 18 per cent higher, up 73¢ to $4.80.<br/>
         <br/>
"I think KKR will get this done," one analyst said.<br/>
         <br/>
"It will need to be above $5 but I think the job is very hard for Mike Clarke now he has to keep one eye on KKR."<br/>
         <br/>
One fund manager said it was "pretty poor" Treasury failed to disclose the bid when it was first made.<br/>
         <br/>
"If you get approached with the stock at $3.70 I would say that was a material bid," the fund manager said.<br/>
         <br/>
It continues a rollercoaster ride for shareholders in Treasury, which was split off from former parent Foster's Group in May 2011 to be a stand-alone listed wine company on the ASX.<br/>
         <br/>
It also marks a tumultuous introduction to Treasury for Mr Clarke who took the helm on March 31 after being recruited from the United Kingdom, where he was chief executive of Premier Foods, which makes Hovis bread and Bisto gravy.<br/>
         <br/>
KKR said on Tuesday its offer represented a 27¢ premium to the Treasury's $3.69 closing price on the day before the proposal was put to the company.<br/>
         <br/>
It also said "has not executed a non-disclosure agreement with TWE, and access to company records per our requests has not been provided''. In practical terms, it has been rebuffed by Treasury, which won't let KKR come in and do serious due diligence.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Shares bounced off a morning low to close stronger as Telstra hit a nine-year high. Investors warmed to the latest confirmation by the Reserve Bank that interest rates are firmly on hold, while shrugging off concerns about declining consumer confidence and a slump in the iron ore price.<br/>
         <br/>Telstra led the bourse into the black, lifting 0.8 per cent to a nine-year high of $5.30, as US research house Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co reiterated its "perform" rating on Australia's largest tele­communications company.<br/>
         <br/>
It has been a long road back for ­Telstra and its investors, but the past 12 months have seen the stock rise 12.55 per cent. Chief executive David Thodey celebrates five years in the job this week, and has billions of dollars to spend on acquisitions and new projects.<br/>
         <br/>
The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX 200 Index and the broader All Ordinaries Index each gained 11.4 points, or 0.2 per cent, on Tuesday to 5420.4 and 5401.7 respectively as shares recovered from a 0.5 per cent drop in the morning ­session despite positive leads from the United States.<br/>
         <br/>
Strength in Asian markets, such as Japan, Hong Kong and India, helped buoy the local bourse in afternoon trade. At the Australian close, the ­Bangkok stock exchange was trading 0.9 per cent lower after the army imposed martial law in Thailand.<br/>
         <br/>
Local shares got a boost following the release of minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia's May policy meeting.<br/>
         <br/>
The central bank board said it intends to keep the official cash rate at a record-low 2.5 per cent for "some time yet" to support an economy likely to slow amid federal budget cuts and softer Chinese demand for iron ore.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury Wine Estates, the owner of Penfolds and Lindemans wines, also helped lift the index as it posted the ­biggest percentage gain among the ASX 200, up 17.9 per cent to $4.80 after rejecting a $4.70-a-share takeover offer from private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, fuelling speculation of a higher bid.<br/>
         <br/>
The market remained buoyant despite a private survey showing ­consumer confidence fell to its worst level since the global financial crisis in 2008 after the release of the federal budget last week.<br/>
         <br/>
The monthly ANZ/Roy Morgan measure of consumer ­sentiment dropped 14 per cent over the past four weeks on budget worries.<br/>
         <br/>
Barclays economist Kieran Davies said he was hopeful the drop in ­confidence will prove temporary as it is offset by an ongoing improvement in employment but presented a downside risk to consumer spending.<br/>
         <br/>
The big four banks were mixed. Commonwealth Bank of Australia added 0.3 per cent to $79.83, ANZ Banking Group gained 0.3 per cent to $32.75, and National Australia Bank lifted 0.5 per cent to $33.10.<br/>
         <br/>
Westpac Banking Corporation fell 0.3 per cent to $33.68.<br/>
         <br/>
ASX debutante Genworth Mortgage Insurance Australia soared 13.2 per cent on listing to $3.<br/>
         <br/>
Stocks in the mining sector were more robust than expected after the spot price for iron ore, landed in China, dropped 2.2 per cent to $US98.50 a tonne, below the psychological ­threshold of $US100 per tonne to its lowest price since September 2012.<br/>
         <br/>
Resources giant BHP Billiton edged up 0.05 per cent to $37.45, while main rival Rio Tinto slipped 0.08 per cent to $60.05.<br/>
         <br/>
Iron ore miner Fortescue Metals Group jumped 3.9 per cent to $4.54 as exploratory drilling showed an additional 1.16 billion tonnes of ore in its Greater Solomon project. "Iron ore producers rallied on Tuesday despite the fall in the commodity price overnight because they had already sold off over the past week in anticipation of the news," Equity Trustees chief investment officer George Boubouras said.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Boubouras forecasts the iron ore price to end 2014 at $US115 per tonne, but expects significant volatility in the meantime as investors react to mixed signals from the supply, demand, and financing factors that influence pricing.<br/>
         <br/>
"Our only exposure to iron ore is through the three biggest players, BHP, Rio and Brazil's Vale, because they are the least volatile," Mr Boubouras said.<br/>
         <br/>
Smaller iron ore miners also rallied, including Mount Gibson Iron, up 2.8 per cent at 74.5¢.<br/>
         <br/>
Hormone therapy maker Acrux Ltd was the worst-performing stock in the ASX 200, down 6.4 per cent to a five-year low at 88.5¢. The stock has suffered a sharp selloff in recent months after the US Food and Drug Administration ordered a report into testosterone treatments. On Tuesday, Macquarie analyst Craig Collie reiterated a "neutral" on the stock with a 12-month target price of $1.<br/>
         <br/>
With global shares riding high against macro-economic backdrop of low growth and low interest rates investors have been grappling over whether better value is to found in stocks or bonds.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">The vexed issue of when boards should disclose takeover approaches has flared yet again as revelations emerge that Treasury Wine Estates had been in secret talks with private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts for weeks while publicly hosing down speculation about other potential deals.<br/>
         <br/>Earlier in the year there was controversy over department store chain David Jones failing to disclose for almost three months that Myer had made a full proposal for a merger of equals on October 28 last year.<br/>
         <br/>
The Australian Financial Review revealed the approach in late January. The issue was complicated further by admissions that David Jones directors had been allowed to buy shares in Myer after it lodged its proposal and before a decision was made to reject it.<br/>
         <br/>
KKR, with corporate advisers from Nomura in its corner, first approached Treasury on Wednesday April 16 about a cash offer. But Treasury didn't disclose it publicly to "preserve the confidentiality of the proposal'' and because premature disclosure would hurt Treasury shareholders. Treasury chief executive Mike Clarke said late on Tuesday the proposal "was subject to a number of different deliverables" and didn't need to be disclosed at that time.<br/>
         <br/>
That policy didn't stop Treasury from going on the front foot when speculating on potential corporate transactions involving its troubled US wine business. On May 2, it told the ASX French drinks giant Pernod Ricard, which owns Jacob's Creek, had not approached it about buying Treasury's US business. On May 15, it lodged a similar response to the ASX in relation to speculation about interest from New York-based alcoholic beverages giant Constellation Brands, saying it "had not been approached by and is not in discussions with Constellation Brands regarding the company's US business".<br/>
         <br/>
But behind the scenes KKR and Treasury were discussing a transaction involving the company and its brands including Penfolds, Rosemount, Lindeman's, Wolf Blass, Wynns and Seppelt. KKR vowed on Tuesday it hadn't breached any confidentiality agreements by going to institutional shareholders in Treasury on a "wall-crossed, confidential basis". Treasury claimed KKR had forced its hand by going to shareholders. Mr Clarke described it as a "leak".<br/>
         <br/>
The ASX points to its Listing Rule 3.1 about continuous disclosure as a guide, which states that once an entity "becomes aware of any information concerning it that a reasonable person would expect, to have a material effect on the price or value of the entity's securities, the entity must immediately tell ASX that information".<br/>
         <br/>
Interestingly, KKR set the ball rolling in late 2006 for the $18 billion takeover of Coles Group by Wesfarmers a year later. KKR came knocking with a proposal, which was quickly disclosed to the ASX and which set in train a torturous auction process and more than a year of instability at Coles.<br/>
         <br/>
Expect a serious bun-fight over Treasury's non-disclosure and the fact that its shares were on the rise in early May as speculation about a separate deal in the US bubbled up. This has implications for benchmark takeover premiums as takeover battles are fought over weeks and months. There is also the question about how skilled private equity operators are when it comes to the wine industry. Wine is notoriously capital-hungry and private equity firm CHAMP have their hands full with Accolade Wines, which sells Hardys, Houghton and Banrock Station.<br/>
         <br/>
CHAMP bought 80 per cent of Accolade for $290 million in 2011 from New York-based Constellation Brands, which retained 20 per cent. Constellation became the owner in 2003 when it made a $1.9 billion takeover for what was then known as BRL Hardy in 2003.<br/>
         <br/>
Accolade two months ago bolstered its balance sheet with a $US300 million new financing package extended by GE Capital International.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury and Accolade have close links. Treasury embarked on a deal in late 2013 to make and package wine for Accolade its facilities in California. In mid-2012 the companies ­consolidated their international bottling operations.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">"Barbarians at the gate" may be the sobriquet associated with the leveraged buyout fund manager KKR in the wake of its controversial $US25 billion purchase of RJR Nabisco 25 years ago – a record value which was not challenged for many years.<br/>
         <br/>But in Australia, a more accurate description could be "always a ­bridesmaid". The private equity giant's $3 billion tilt at Treasury Wine Estates – owner of Penfolds – has thrust KKR back into the spotlight, but in reality the firm has a long history in Australia, and a mixed track record in getting deals over the line.<br/>
         <br/>
KKR burst onto the local scene in 2006 when it paid a mouthwatering $1.8 billion for the Cleanaway unit of Brambles with the waste assets onsold for $1.25 billion a year later to Trans­pacific Industries. It retained the BIS unit, so KKR probably came out ahead on the play.<br/>
         <br/>
But successful bids since have been scant.<br/>
         <br/>
In late 2006 KKR was unveiled as a potential bidder for Coles Myer, but board eventually agreed to a weaker offer from Wesfarmers.<br/>
         <br/>
Ditto KKR's $1.75 billion pitch in 2010 for fund manager Perpetual, which also failed. Perpetual is now valued in the market at $2.1 billion.<br/>
         <br/>
Then there was the bid – 50 minutes late – for a block of 7 per cent of Transpacific Industries which was auctioned in 2012. KKR bid 66¢ for the shares, which were sold for 62¢.<br/>
         <br/>
"The KKR bid was received some 50 minutes after the book had closed and I'd compare the situation to ­someone trying to bid at a house auction after close," a Transpacific official said at the time.<br/>
         <br/>
At around the same time it also looked at Pacific Brands, but decided to keep its hands in its pocket. Likewise with Pact Group, which floated onto the ASX six months ago.<br/>
         <br/>
There has been recurring talk of a float by BIS but the downturn in the mining industry has put paid to that.<br/>
         <br/>
So, it has kicked plenty of tyres, but to little effect. In between, there was a joint venture with Kerry Stokes, with KKR putting $735 million into a joint venture with the businessman which took ­control of Channel 7, Pacific Magazines and its local online joint venture with Yahoo!.<br/>
         <br/>
That venture wound up a year ago, but figuring out whether KKR made or lost money is all but impossible, with the upswing in the Australian dollar against the greenback over the seven years of this venture likely to have seen the US firm come out ahead – just.<br/>
         <br/>
Yet at least – unlike some other ­leveraged buy-out investors – it would appear not to have lost money on its local forays, unlike CVC Capital, which lost a thumping $US1.8 billion on an ill-judged buyout of the Nine Network.<br/>
         <br/>
Just this week, it raised $US3.5 billion ($3.8 billion) for a new Asian fund, but its disastrous experience Down Under has prompted the firm to vow never to return to Australia.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Penfolds wine has long been the jewel of Treasury Wine Estates' crown, and a rejection of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts's $3.1 billion takeover bid shows TWE is unwilling to part with its prized drop.<br/>
         <br/>While TWE owns 80 brands in total, Penfolds is central to their operation as a premium brand that can deliver strong margins and provide a halo for the entire portfolio of wines.<br/>
         <br/>
Penfolds began life as a family business which produced wine as a medicinal tonic to treat anaemia.<br/>
         <br/>
Englishman Dr Christopher Penfold and his wife Mary bought the Magill estate in 1844 and Mary Penfold took up the task of managing and curating the wine.<br/>
         <br/>
By 1870, the 60 acres of several grape varieties was producing over one-third of South Australia's wine. Mary Penfold remained at the helm of Penfold&amp;Co, working in partnership with her son-in-law, Thomas Hyland, and cellar manager Joseph Gillard.<br/>
         <br/>
In 1980, a subsidiary of the Adelaide Steamship Group purchased the winery and a decade later, it was sold to SA Brewery Holdings, which amalgamated all its wine holdings under the Penfolds banner.<br/>
         <br/>
SA Brewery was broken into three separate groups before its wine arm, Southcorp Wines, was sold to Foster's in 2005. TWE was spun off from Foster's in 2011, taking Penfold with it.<br/>
         <br/>
Penfolds and TWE are no strangers to defying the market and following their own direction. Since its origins, self-determinism was integral to the success of its flagship Grange.<br/>
         <br/>
From its experimental beginnings in 1951, the Grange Hermitage was divisive, with a testing of the 1951-1956 Granges resulting in criticism by wine experts and management alike.<br/>
         <br/>
In 1957, head office directed chief winemaker Max Schubert to end production of the wine but in defiance, Schubert continued making it in secret until the 1959 Grange achieved general acceptance and the board quietly reversed their ban. The 1955 Grange, initially rejected by all critics, went on to win 50 gold medals before Penfolds retired it from shows.<br/>
         <br/>
But its controversial beginnings are nothing compared to the recent notoriety achieved by Penfolds' 1959 Grange Hermitage: the wine that destroyed a premier.<br/>
         <br/>
Australia's most infamous wine was thrust into the political and media light after becoming the centrepiece of an ICAC investigation. Former NSW premier Barry O'Farrell stood down after evidence showed he did not declare the $3000 gift given to him by AWH's Nick Di Girolamo.<br/>
         <br/>
TWE said it would carefully consider any future proposals that maximise shareholder value, but for now, Penfolds remains securely TWE's from "1844 to evermore", as its label says.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">The performance of Treasury Wine Estates (TWE) over the past year has had more than a few shareholders reaching for the bottle so it should not be a huge surprise that an opportunistic private equity firm has as come knocking.<br/>
         <br/>The winemaker, which produces Penfolds and Lindeman's, dropped a bombshell on Tuesday with news that it had knocked back a $3.1 billion takeover offer from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR).<br/>
         <br/>
The sudden decision to reveal an approach made more than a month ago is even more intriguing given the company has spent the past week denying reports it had received approaches from Constellation Capital and others for its struggling US operations.<br/>
         <br/>
The trigger was KKR's decision to talk a number of TWE's shareholders about the approach, which chief executive Michael Clarke describes as a "leak" which obligated the company to inform the market.<br/>
         <br/>
TWE has been a constant subject of takeover speculation since the day it was spun out of Foster's in 2011 but there is a sense of inevitability it will be taken out this time round.<br/>
         <br/>
KKR is the latest in a string of private equity and potential trade buyers linked to a company which has lost the confidence of investors following a string of profit downgrades, a pricing stuff-up over Christmas and a messy management transition under chairman Paul Raynor.<br/>
         <br/>
Another private equity firm, Cerberus, offered Foster's $2.3 billion to $2.7 billion for the wine business when it was still owned by Foster's in 2010. TPG, which made a packet selling Beringer to Foster's in 2000, and TPG have also reportedly looked at the company.<br/>
         <br/>
More recently, the talk has focused TWE's troubled US operations. TWE last week played down reports Constellation Brands and premium beverage group Pernod Ricard were looking at its North American business. At the time, TWE did not see the need to mention the fact that KKR had made an offer for the entire business.<br/>
         <br/>
That approach was rejected, but the company looks riper than ever for a takeover bid. This is reflected by an 18 per cent jump in the company's share price which closed at $4.80 on Tuesday following news that KKR had come knocking.<br/>
         <br/>
Comparisons will be made to bread maker Goodman Fielder which last week bowed to a modest takeover offer from two Asian investors who took advantage of the company's weak share price. A string of earnings downgrades and lack of confidence in the future meant key Goodman Fielder investors were willing to sell their stakes even though the premium was not as high as they would have liked.<br/>
         <br/>
The difference with a suitor such as KKR is that the private equity firm does not have a track record of engaging in hostile takeover bids. It prefers to avoid bad blood and negotiate on good terms with a target board, although talking to shareholders has had the opposite affect.<br/>
         <br/>
KKR made a non-binding and indicative $4.70 cash bid for the company, one that would imply a value of $3.05 billion. That was rejected by TWE on April 16 when the stock was trading a $3.70, which meant the offer represented a 27 per cent premium at the time.<br/>
         <br/>
While both sides agreed to keep the engagement confidential, TWE spat the dummy after KKR spoke to a number of its investors about the offer. Both sides have different opinions about whether the cone of silence has been breached or not.<br/>
         <br/>
TWE chief executive Clarke says by doing so KKR broke the terms of that confidentiality and it decided to announce the approach to ensure the market was informed. In a conference call late on Tuesday he said TWE did engage with KKR and suggested there would have been continued dialogue if there had not been a "leak".<br/>
         <br/>
KKR disputes this, saying there was never a formal non-disclosure agreement with TWE in the first place. Second, talks between its advisers and the shareholders were on a confidential basis and would not have been made public anyway.<br/>
         <br/>
Whatever the motive was for going public, the process highlights the minefield companies face when it comes to disclosure obligations. While it was not technically obligated to disclose the approach, the company selectively left out the fact it had been sitting on a $3 billion offer while denying talk Constellation was looking at the US operations.<br/>
         <br/>
A hastily issued press release, which initially said the proposal was received in 2016, highlights how quickly things moved from being an amicable discussion to a dispute over confidentiality.<br/>
         <br/>
The key now is TWE's shareholders who can pressure Raynor to engage with the private equity firm, hopefully to agitate for a higher offer. Clarke appeared to be leaving the door open for further talks.<br/>
         <br/>
There are several schools of thought. The company could take the money and run, sell of the US operations or pursue Clarke's promise to turn things around.<br/>
         <br/>
The decision to disclose the KKR approach also forced Clarke to fast-forward an announcement around cost cutting and plans to ramp up its consumer market spending. It is targeting $35 million in cost savings in financial 2015, which will involve cutting 5 per cent of its 3500-plus workforce. The company has not exactly issued an earnings downgrade but it may as well have given the downbeat tone of Clarke's commentary, which avoided committing to the numbers either way.<br/>
         <br/>
The next six weeks of trading are crucial for the company's outlook, but at the same time Clarke wants investors to take a longer-term approach when judging the company's potential value. UBS is forecasting 2014 earning of $182 million compared with TWE's guidance of $190 million to $210 million.<br/>
         <br/>
Clarke's strategy rests on investing in the company's luxury brands and has identified spending priorities for 20 of its 83 brands. He still views the US business as a growth platform.<br/>
         <br/>
It is still early days for Clarke, who has only been in the top job for seven weeks and Tuesday's conference call with investors will do little to resurrect confidence in the company. He says there are still some other structural changes he is working on but not ready to announce yet, while trading in Australia is challenging.<br/>
         <br/>
The strategic rationale behind KKR's interest is TWE's strong luxury brands with Penfolds the absolute jewel in the crown. The private equity firm does not view the company as an Australian-specific acquisition but likes TWE for the ability to sell its brands more effectively into Asia and China in particular. A break-up is inevitable under private equity ownership and there appears to be no shortage of buyers for the US operations.<br/>
         <br/>
There is clearly scope for KKR to go higher. Morgan Stanley analysts note that wine assets tend to trade on high multiples given their strategic value. The median of the past 24 wine transactions is 13.2x trailing EBITDA, which imply $5.18 a share for TWE. The bid will put the spotlight back on to Raynor-installed director Warwick Every-Burns as an interim chief executive after sacking former chief David Dearie in mid-2013. This followed an embarrassing $160 million write-down on the US business where six million bottles of low-priced wine were destroyed.<br/>
         <br/>
Goldman Sachs is advising Treasury Wine, while Nomura is advising KKR.<br/>
         <br/>
Unable to afford to take out Duet Group in a takeover bid, Spark Infrastructure is positioning itself for next round of consolidation in the energy space by buying a strategic stake in its rival.<br/>
         <br/>
Spark boss Rick Francis has been keen to do a big deal since he came on board in 2012. After losing out on the NSW desalination plant sale and passing on the Moomba-Adelaide gas line deal, Francis has been scouting the market for deals.<br/>
         <br/>
While some analysts question Spark's motives, the deal looks like it gives them a seat at the table if there is another round of consolidation.<br/>

              <div class="document-view__body">Shares in Treasury Wine Estates, the world's biggest listed winemaker and owner of brands such as Penfolds, Wolf Blass and Rosemount, rocketed nearly 15 per cent on Friday morning on rumours that global French drinks giant Pernod Ricard could be circling to snap up key assets of the business, including its billion-dollar US vineyards and wine labels.<br/>
         <br/>Treasury Wine Estates hit a high of $4.38 in brisk early trade, as more than 5.5 million shares traded hands and lifted the stock 14.4 per cent.<br/>
         <br/>
The stock closed up 14¢, or 6.5 per cent, at $4.22.<br/>
         <br/>
In a statement, Treasury denied being approached by or being involved in talks with Pernod Ricard. The company also said it wouldn't comment on share price movements.<br/>
         <br/>
Since Treasury Wine Estates was demerged from brewer Foster's and floated on the Australian Securities Exchange it has been the subject of heavy takeover speculation. Its iconic wine brands and assets are on the shopping list of most global players in the wine and wider beverages market.<br/>
         <br/>
Jean-Christophe Coutures, chairman and chief executive of the wine division of Pernod Ricard – whose brands include Absolut vodka, Beefeater gin, GH Mumm champagne and Australian wine Jacob's Creek – also scotched talk of a deal.<br/>
         <br/>
"Last week we announced the acquisition of Kenwood Vineyards in the US.We have not been in talks with Treasury Wine Estates or looking to acquire any further wine assets in the US market at this time."</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Wine label Penfolds is celebrating 170 years by releasing a shiraz with a difference, writes Julie-anne Sprague.<br/>
         <br/>Treasury Wine Estates chief executive Michael Clarke is taking a cold approach to the winemaker's brands as part of a fresh strategy to revive earnings for the world's largest stand-alone listed wine company.<br/>
         <br/>
Clarke has no emotional attachment to brands, instead focusing on wine labels, cutting costs, and improving consumer marketing.<br/>
         <br/>
However, he does makes an exception.<br/>
         <br/>
"If I'm totally honest, I am emotional about Penfolds," Clarke told investors last month in his first public comments since being recruited to improve Treasury's fortunes. "Thank God we've got that in our portfolio."<br/>
         <br/>
This month is crucial for Penfolds and Treasury. Penfolds is the engine room of Treasury's profit and critical for the group to achieve full-year earnings guidance.<br/>
         <br/>
The annual May release of Penfolds' icon wines, including Grange, is always met with great fanfare but this year comes with a huge weight of expectation.<br/>
         <br/>
Penfolds is without a 2008 Grange, the wine that received a perfect score from Robert Parker's Wine Advocate, triggering – to the disgust of some wine retailers – price rises before it even hit the retail shelves this time last year. The 2009 – yes, priced the same as the 2008 at $785 a bottle – will no doubt be good, but it's no 2008.<br/>
         <br/>
At the same time, China's demand for luxury wines is faltering.<br/>
         <br/>
Recent figures released by Wine Australia show exports of premium red wines – or wines priced about $7.50 a litre – have slipped 11 per cent in the year to March, compared with a 6 per cent drop for all bottled wine exports to China.Rabbit out of a hat<br/>
         <br/>
So how does Penfolds pull a rabbit out of its hat, and generate fresh excitement and all-important sales?<br/>
         <br/>
With a parcel of fruit from its old vines at block 3C in the Barossa Valley's Kalimna vineyard and help from the Queen's nephew, David Albert Charles Armstrong-Jones, Viscount Linley.<br/>
         <br/>
David Linley, the son of Princess Margaret, chairs his bespoke furniture and cabinetry company Linley. He is also chairman at auction house Christie's UK.<br/>
         <br/>
Linley been commissioned to design special wooden boxes for a special release wine – the 2010 Bin 170 Kalimna shiraz, a single vineyard wine not made since 1973.<br/>
         <br/>
Launched by Penfolds winemaker Peter Gago in London, on May 1, at $1800 a standard bottle it is the most expensive bottled wine released by Penfolds in its 170-year history ( its most expensive release is the $168,000 ampoule, released in 2012).<br/>
         <br/>
Launching the shiraz in London, the birthplace of Penfolds founder Christopher Rawson Penfold, lends old world charm to the new world producer celebrating its 170th year.<br/>
         <br/>
The original Bin 170, released only once before in 1973, was meant to be blended with Bin 169 Coonawarra cabernet sauvignon to create a Bin 60A. Instead it was released as a stand-alone wine.<br/>
         <br/>
This wine has been made many times since and, while it has never been commercially released, it has occasionally been entered in wine shows, winning a swag of gold medals for Penfolds.<br/>
         <br/>
Usually, the wine from Block 3C is blended for Grange.Limited supply<br/>
         <br/>
Penfolds doesn't usually reveal how limited its supplies of elite wines are. It has made a rare exception for the 2010 Bin 170 Kalimna shiraz, which will be sold in imperials, magnums and standard bottles. All up, there are just 5544 bottles.<br/>
         <br/>
Of those, there are 11 imperials (six litres) – with only seven released commercially for $65,500. There are about 5000 magnums, priced at $4800 a bottle.<br/>
         <br/>
The bottles are housed in bespoke wooden cases designed by Linley. The imperial box features a compass and can only be opened with the combination of the longitude and latitude co-ordinates of Penfolds' Magill Estate.<br/>
         <br/>
Linley began the design in June 2013. The boxes took about 80 hours to craft and a further 40 hours to polish, plate and engrave; the time involved was largely due to the complexity of the engineered locks. The lid is customised with the buyer's name accompanying the bottle number.<br/>
         <br/>
The cachet of special packaging is usually reserved for a wine other than shiraz, says Phil Hude, who runs Armadale Cellars in Melbourne.<br/>
         <br/>
"Champagne has always relied on packaging to offer something different," Hude says. "It creates interest and some hype. When Penfolds did that ampoule they may have only made a dozen but look how much coverage they got for it. It was worth millions."<br/>
         <br/>
Vince Salpietro designs cellars for wealthy executives, including BRW Rich lister Nigel Satterley. He expects the wine to flow to the cellars of Chinese multimillionaires and says Penfolds are taking a leaf out of the marketing playbook mastered by Bordeaux first growth producers.Captivating story<br/>
         <br/>
"Before you have even tasted it, you are so into the story of where the wine is from, how it has been crafted and everything else that it can taste like vinegar and you'll love it," Salpietro says.<br/>
         <br/>
Such is the power of luxury.<br/>
         <br/>
But Gago is staking his reputation of what's in the bottle. And it's not vinegar. Unblended and matured for 16 months in French oak, 55 per cent new, the 2010 Bin 170 Kalimna Shiraz can be cellared until 2055, long after Penfolds turns 200 in 2044.<br/>
         <br/>
"Why does this luxury stuff belong to the French? Why doesn't little old Australia play with the big boys?" Gago argues. "With our reds, we are right up there."<br/>
         <br/>
Critics will jump on this release as being a gimmick. A Bin 170 released as Penfolds celebrates its 170th anniversary?<br/>
         <br/>
Gago is quick to point out that the wine, which has been in bottle since 2011, was supposed to be released last year – proof that the wine is the real deal.<br/>
         <br/>
"It didn't have the name 170 but it was wine we had kept to one side," Gago explains. "It was meant to be released last year but someone around the table said guess what? We are turning 170 in 2014 . It wasn't purpose built to be a commemorative but it couldn't have worked better."<br/>
         <br/>
He says deciding whether the wine could make a standalone product, worthy of special status, is challenging. "If you were to listen to the bean counters there'd be a special bin release every three years," Gago says.<br/>
         <br/>
Wine buyers in Australia can pick up bottles at Penfolds' cellar door, Langton's or at Duty Free stores.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Who would pay $785 for a bottle of wine? Many, according to ­Campbell Stott, merchandise manager for Woolworths' liquor chain, Dan Murphy's, which is limiting customers to two bottles of the new Penfolds Grange which goes on sale on Thursday.<br/>
         <br/>A hot spell which affected the 2009 vintage has cut the amount of Grange on sale this year.<br/>
         <br/>
Wine experts agree the 2009 vintage isn't the highest quality compared with other vintages, which are sold five years after the grapes are picked.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Stott said the number of bottles allocated to Dan Murphy's, which runs 185 stores around Australia, was about 50 per cent lower than normal.<br/>
         <br/>
While it hadn't received the glowing reviews that the 2008 Penfolds Grange garnered last year, it is still likely to be sought after by collectors and higher-end drinkers.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Stott said many customers were collectors who religiously purchase a bottle each year, while it was also popular to buy a bottle of Grange in a child's birth year and cellar it, to give to them when they turn 21.<br/>
         <br/>
Sydney Morning Herald wine writer Huon Hooke in March described the 2009 Grange as "a very good wine, a worthy Grange, but certainly not a top-level Grange. It lacks the fruit intensity of a great Grange and has some 'cooked fruit' hot-year characteristics."<br/>
         <br/>
Jules Gutierrez, the fine wine manager at North Sydney Cellars, said some older vintages were better value.<br/>
         <br/>
He said a few weeks ago a businessman from South Korea bought 11 bottles of Grange from 1990, 1991 and 1998. The most highly sought after by customers among the back vintages was 1990, which North Sydney Cellars has for a shelf price of $750.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Gutierrez said Grange had an international reputation. "Most of the Grange purchased by our customers are intended as gifts for other people," he said. "It's very disconnected from the actual taste of the wine, it's more the association."<br/>
         <br/>
Penfolds, owned by Treasury Wine Estates, has kept the recommended retail price of the 2009 Penfolds Grange at $785 per bottle, the same as last year. The wine was made even more famous through its role in the downfall this month of NSW premier Barry O'Farrell, who resigned over a gift of a 1959 bottle of Penfolds Grange.<br/>
         <br/>
The cellar door at the Penfolds Magill winery in the Adelaide foothills, which is regarded as the spiritual home of Grange even though the wine is bottled in the Barossa Valley, will open at 8am on Thursday instead of the usual 10am opening time.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">New chief has a global vision for battling wine company.<br/>
         <br/>It was on an English golf course that an out-of-work Mike Clarke first heard of the world's biggest stand-alone listed wine company, Treasury Wine Estates.<br/>
         <br/>
As the seasoned, fast-moving ­consumer goods executive took to the tee in July 2013, his golfing partner mentioned the spectacular destruction of shareholder value occurring on the other side of the globe.<br/>
         <br/>
"He was talking about this company that had done this massive inventory write-down and we were both commenting on what a shame that was; to write down inventory and good quality product," Clarke recalls.<br/>
         <br/>
Less than a year later, the 50-year-old South African has taken the helm of the winemaker to resuscitate earnings for the maker of Penfolds, Wolf Blass, Wynns and Rosemount.<br/>
         <br/>
The plan is to cut costs, including staff, trim the number of wine brands and boost consumer branding.<br/>
         <br/>
Unfortunately for Clarke, a new boss talking up a fresh strategy to realise Treasury's true potential has been a recurring theme for the Melbourne-based company.Executive churn<br/>
         <br/>
For a business operating with long term fundamentals – decisions in the vineyard can take at least three years to materialise – it has acquired a nasty habit of churning chief executives.<br/>
         <br/>
Its most recent, David Dearie, was in the top job for 2½ years, before problems selling wine in the US triggered a $155 million write-down, claiming his scalp. It's little wonder some analysts and investors are jaded.<br/>
         <br/>
"The strategy announced by the new chief executive echoed the strategy announced by Keith Lambert in 2001, Jamie Odell in 2004 and 2008 and David Dearie in 2010," JPMorgan analyst ­Stuart Jackson told investors this week.<br/>
         <br/>
But Clarke impressed the market with his tough talking this week.<br/>
         <br/>
"Rest assured, I'm looking at every single option that all the analysts have articulated in the reports," Clarke told investors on Tuesday. "Everything is on the table."<br/>
         <br/>
Several analysts and investors have been calling for some time for Treasury to sell its troublesome US operations.<br/>
         <br/>
Clarke has since clarified that while he is looking at all options, it's options to fix the business, not sell it. The US, he says, remains important to Treasury's growth outlook.The problem for Clarke is that many before him have held the same view and failed to deliver.Earnings dwindle<br/>
         <br/>
It remains to be seen how long they give Clarke and the board to get it right, considering Treasury has failed to deliver acceptable returns since Foster's paid $2.9 billion for Beringer in 2000. Earnings are now about a 10th of what they were 14 years ago.<br/>
         <br/>
"We believe that Treasury's commitment to its US business is impeding the ability of the company to reach its full potential," Merrill Lynch analyst David Errington says.<br/>
         <br/>
Errington has estimated a sale of Treasury's US business could yield up to $1 billion.<br/>
         <br/>
Clarke is confident he has the backing of chairman Paul Rayner to execute his "road map" for Treasury, a "journey" he anticipates will take about five years.<br/>
         <br/>
Before agreeing to the job, Clarke met each director and sent the board a one-page document outlining his vision for the company.<br/>
         <br/>
Clarke, a keen surfer, was born in South Africa, where he trained as an accountant before leaving at 21 to take a job with Deloitte in Hong Kong, where he met and married his wife.<br/>
         <br/>
"Any team that's playing against England I support, just to wind her up," Clarke says.<br/>
         <br/>
And the other big sporting question?<br/>
         <br/>
"Whoever in our organisation who had the guts to come up to me in say this is the [AFL] team you should support, this is why and this is what you should wear . . . I would choose that team," he says, although noting he wanted to choose a team close to the company's vineyards.<br/>
         <br/>
"One of our guys at the Wynns [winery] facility said the team you need to join is the Adelaide Crows."</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Treasury Wine Estates chief executive Mike Clarke will slash jobs, cut wine brands and consider selling the winemaker's US operations as part of a turnaround strategy to restore faith with battered investors.<br/>
         <br/>It will form the first part of a five -year journey to improve shareholder returns following more than a decade of persistent write-downs that have plagued the nation's biggest winemaker by revenue.<br/>
         <br/>
Its brands include Penfolds, Wolf Blass, Lindemans, Rosemount and Wynns.<br/>
         <br/>
"There has been a lot of talk in this company and not necessarily a lot of delivery," Mr Clarke told investors in his first public comments since relocating from London to Melbourne last month.<br/>
         <br/>
Within weeks, Mr Clarke, who becomes the company's sixth chief executive in four years, will have a handle on the quantum of the job cuts as he tries to pinch funds to throw at consumer marketing and brand building that he says will improve wine sales.<br/>
         <br/>
"It will mean there will be some jobs that come out of our business."<br/>
         <br/>
He also tipped cuts to spending on consultants and within its supply chain while it was also to quit "tail" wine brands.<br/>
         <br/>
"I think we do have too many brands in our portfolio," Mr Clarke said, noting that at last count the company had 83 brands.<br/>
         <br/>
"There's some 'tail' that we need to address."<br/>
         <br/>
He said the company's top brands would get the "lion-sized" chunk of its consumer marketing spend as it engaged with consumers "and drive them in to stores".<br/>
         <br/>
The market responded positively to his comments, pushing Treasury shares up 7.2 per cent, or 26¢, to $3.87.<br/>
         <br/>
The market has become used to turnaround plans and ambitions to deliver sustainable profits.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Clarke replaces David Dearie, who was shown the door by the board after an embarrassing $155 million write down at the hands of its problematic US business last June.<br/>
         <br/>
"I was playing golf with a friend of mine in the UK and he was talking about this company that had done this massive inventory write down and we were both commenting on what a shame that was, to write down inventory and good quality product," Mr Clarke saidMr Clarke, 50, has a long career in fast moving consumer goods, leading a turnaround for Kraft's European operations and more recently salvaging distressed Premier Foods, the company behind Hovis bread, Mr Kipling cakes and Bisto gravy.<br/>
         <br/>
Analysts were scathing of Treasury chairman Paul Rayner's decision to pick an executive with no wine experience. Mr Clarke said he suffered similar criticism when he left Coca-Cola to join Kraft in 2009.<br/>
         <br/>
He said investors were concerned an executive that knew nothing about food was responsible for improving the fortunes of a $13 billion business.<br/>
         <br/>
"Very quickly I became the top performing business unit in Kraft globally," he said<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Clarke is committed to the delivery the company's earnings guidance but warned he would not make decisions that impacted the long term health of the business. He highlighted how significant its Penfolds brand is to the company.<br/>
         <br/>
While it has 83 brands it is Penfolds that delivers the lion's share of its profits, which means its current quarter, when it releases the Penfolds luxury range include Grange, is its largest for sales. "I'm not emotional about any part of our business," he said.<br/>
         <br/>
"But I am emotional about Penfolds. That's a gem that I think we have a good job with and I think we can do an even better with Penfolds. If we can do ­something good with Penfolds we can probably do something good with the rest of our portfolio." One shareholder, who declined to be named, said: "words are cheap, actions are more important".<br/>
         <br/>
The shareholder was concerned that while Mr Clarke was considering all options, including calls by the market to sell its US operations, he may find it difficult to do because the board has indicated they want to retain the division.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Clarke has unofficially been working in the business for about three weeks and spent a week in the US understanding its operations.<br/>
         <br/>
He officially took on the job on March 31. He said "there is a lot that needs to be fixed".</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">It says much of the mislaid potential of Treasury Wine Estates that the first glimpse of executive clear-thinking, commercial smarts and oratorical clarity served to add more than 7 per cent to its crisis-crushed winemaker's share price.<br/>
         <br/>Michael Clarke's first contact on Tuesday with investors and analysts went exceeding well, with the new boss indicating that everything was on the table, that "cold" and unemotional decisions would be taken and that the market would not have to wait long to see rhetoric translate into action.<br/>
         <br/>
Given the frustration and scepticism released by his confirmation in February, things could have gone very poorly indeed in this debut outing for Clarke.<br/>
         <br/>
But he disarmed the potentially hostile with the judicious use of agreement and then hinted, without any firm commitment, at the shape of the reforms already formulating a week into his tenure.<br/>
         <br/>
So we heard how past TWE management had failed to deliver on two years of promises to the market and failed to unlock the value of either TWE's assets or people and deal with obvious structural problems.<br/>
         <br/>
"There is a lot that needs to be fixed," Clarke started, adding that he agreed with much that had been said and written about the challenges that cloud his new business.<br/>
         <br/>
With that, Clarke, who demonstrated his clear preference to distill problems and their solutions into neat and digestible trinities, defined TWE's strengths as its quality wines, its strong balance sheet and its talented people.<br/>
         <br/>
Clarke's pitch was sustained by the idea that past turnarounds at Kraft's European food colony and Premier Foods in the UK left him well prepared to extract full shareholder value from each of those core positives.<br/>
         <br/>
His repeated reference to the structural challenges he is identifying as he tours the TWE business suggested that he plans to deal with the biggest problem facing this business. The simple fact is that since Foster's spent $US2.9 billion to acquire a footing in the US wine business, this business has been burning shareholder wealth. And it is TWE's US outposts that the market identifies as the problem Clarke must deal with promptly and definitively.<br/>
         <br/>
Given the commercial qualities hinted at yesterday and demonstrated by his past successes, the market might well be prepared to give Clarke a bit of time to set the US ship right.<br/>
         <br/>
But it is hard to believe that this crippling misadventure, now nearly 15 years old, can suddenly be righted for the longer term. Any improvement simply has to be aimed at sustaining the conscious uncoupling that the market so desires.<br/>
         <br/>
It has to be said that Clarke offered some real hope that some hard decisions will be taken. In response to allegations that past management had proven too emotionally attached to assets generally and the US business specifically, Clarke said he arrived with no emotional attachment to anything in the portfolio.<br/>
         <br/>
Happily, he later offered one exception to that, thanking God that Penfolds was part of his business and expressing firm confidence in its business model and its current management.<br/>
         <br/>
Clarke introduced his pitch with a forgivably tepid recommitment to profit forecasts offered in interim management in February.<br/>
         <br/>
He said the targets remained live but in the next breath he offered the quite acceptable caveats that there was not a lot he could do to influence the result given the fourth quarter was already upon him and that he would not "chase a full-year number to the detriment of a long-term plan".<br/>
         <br/>
In February, acting CEO Warwick Every-Burns promised TWE's FY14 EBIT would range between $190 million and $210 million.<br/>
         <br/>
This seemed a big call back in February, not least because the December half EBIT came in at a lowly $45.8 million.<br/>
         <br/>
To hit the bottom of the target range TWE needs to throw off more than $145 million in the second half. To do that it needs to outperform the FY13 second half, which was $138.1 million. And there was not a lot that Every-Burns offered which generated confidence such a momentum shift was within his reach.<br/>
         <br/>
Bill Doyle's retirement from Potash of Saskatchewan will doubtless be watched with some considerable interest by the potash wannabes at BHP Billiton. Big Bill is the bloke from Chicago that Canadians like to imagine is the face of the $US20 billion global potash market. They also like to recall he was the guy who stared down BHP Billiton when Marius Kloppers came knocking in 2010 with a $US40 billion hostile takeover.<br/>
         <br/>
The truth is rather more complicated. POS was not saved from BHP's acquisitive claws by Doyle's commercial cunning nor the brilliant promise of his business. No. POS was saved for Canadian prosperity by a government slightly irritated by the global Australian's self-possession and by a conservative prime minister keen to sustain his party's grip on key seats in Saskatchewan.<br/>
         <br/>
And, as the recent turmoil has demonstrated all too clearly, the face of potash is Russian, rich and driven by a quite different set of priorities to those that have guided Doyle's 15 years at the top of the fertilizer heap.<br/>
         <br/>
The recent tiff between Russia's Uralkali and its erstwhile partner in potash marketing from Belarus that triggered a worrying collapse in potash prices served only to demonstrate the potential for a meaningful shift in the balance of power in the potash export marketplace. It is hard to believe that risks exposed by the dispute on potash's eastern front that is as yet unresolved did not contribute to the board's decision that the time for fresh eyes might have come.<br/>
         <br/>
Mind you, Doyle has also endured criticism for spending $C8 billion ($7.9 billion) and more against new capacity at a time when the market is over-supplied and the price is already in retreat. To that end, the narrative of his departure has a ring very familiar.<br/>
         <br/>
So, why does any of this matter to BHP and its new management?<br/>
         <br/>
Well, Andrew Mackenzie was the bloke who ultimately ran the nitty gritty of BHP's pitch for potash and was the man most personally aggrieved by the government's decision. And Mackenzie has made it known often enough since he took over at BHP last year that potash is his potential fifth pillar.<br/>
         <br/>
Mackenzie reckons BHP is owner of the best undeveloped potash in Saskatchewan. By 2017, BHP will have spent $US3.8 billion ($4.1 billion) on collecting tenements and completing two preparatory shafts at its Jansen project. It's an option that ticks a lot of Mackenzie's boxes. It is a commodity that requires complex mining, that is in an OECD constituency and that would be extracted from a long-life basin-play equivalent to sat BHP's iron ore in the Pilbara.<br/>
         <br/>
But Jansen would be an expensive business to develop, costing maybe $US20 billion or more and it is evident BHP does not want to carry the financial load and risk on its own, so it is seeking partners for the project.<br/>
         <br/>
And then there is the issue of how to market the stuff.<br/>
         <br/>
Currently the potash export market is under polarised influence of two marketing cartels, one that represents the three current Canadian producers and the other the currently dysfunctional partnership between Uralkali and Belaruskali.<br/>
         <br/>
If BHP enters the market it will be the outlier, selling its product direct to customers and oblivious of the constraints of Canpotex, the Canadian cartel.<br/>
         <br/>
To make a complicated story too simple, BHP's view is that markets will respond rationally to this shift. But not everyone accepts that certainty, if only because there is not a whole lot rational that happens in Russia.<br/>
         <br/>
The big question for BHP right now is whether or not Doyle's replacement, current INMET boss Jochen Tilk, will entertain more open-minded conversation than his predecessor. Would a Tilk-managed POS be interested in aligning itself with BHP's progress on Jansen, for example. And, more importantly, is an operator like Tilk – who has spent a working life selling into open-call metals markets – going to be content selling product through an export cartel?</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Mike Clarke, the new chief executive of Treasury Wine Estates, will brief analysts this week for the first time as he tries to rebuild market confidence in the company using skills he's gathered while selling Reebok sporting goods, Kraft food brands, Coca-Cola, Hovis bread and Bisto gravy over two decades.<br/>
         <br/>After a busy first week beginning on March 31 which included a large number of meetings with a diverse range of Treasury's workforce, Mr Clarke turns his attention on Tuesday this week to a briefing with analysts in a first step in the rebuilding process.<br/>
         <br/>
It will be an uphill battle, with Treasury's share price languishing at $3.60 after the latest profit stumble caused by a misstep in strategy in the crucial Christmas trading period in Australia. There is also a sharp focus on the ailing United States business and whether it belongs in the Treasury stable, or whether an $800 million-plus sale of the US operations might be the best option. Speculation about takeover bids for Treasury is a constant in the market.Winning back confidence<br/>
         <br/>
Winning back the confidence of the liquor trade will be crucial in Mr Clarke's tenure. The company has a prized collection of brands including Penfolds, Wolf Blass, Lindemans, Rosemount and Wynns but delivering consistent returns has proved elusive since Treasury demerged from the former Foster's Group in late 2011.<br/>
         <br/>
Tony D'Anna, owner of Boccaccio Cellars in the leafy Melbourne suburb of Balwyn, said the higher-end Penfolds brands such as Grange, Bin 389, Bin 707 and St Henri still had substantial cache with customers. "They're still holding their own," he said.<br/>
         <br/>
But the Penfolds offerings below them had lost their zip because of constant changes in pricing and heavy discounting in the larger liquor chains owned by supermarket giants Woolworths and Coles.<br/>
         <br/>
A initial director's interest notice filed with the Australian Securities Exchange on Friday showed that Mr Clarke didn't yet own any shares in Treasury. A handful of Treasury directors last month topped up their own shareholdings in the company. Lyndsey Cattermole bought an extra 1000 Treasury shares at $3.75 each on March 14, fellow director Ed Chan bought an extra 3000 at $3.75 each the same day and Michael Cheek added 2666 extra Treasury shares to his holding as they used the buying window allowed under the director's share acquisition plan.Softened blow<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury shareholders will be paid their 6 cents per share interim dividend on April 10 which will partially soften some of the blow of the ailing share price and memories of last year's horrific $160 million in writedowns stemming from the troublesome US business. That also included the now infamous announcement that $35 million of wine would be destroyed in the US after an inventory blowout in third-party distributor warehouses in low-end commercial wine, which later claimed the scalp of then chief executive David Dearie.<br/>
         <br/>
The board was effectively in control of Treasury for six months until Mr Clarke started, with chairman Paul Rayner having installed fellow director Warwick Every-Burns as stand-in chief executive.<br/>
         <br/>
There is solid upside if Mr Clarke can win the confidence of the market, although any further strife will increase the clamour for a break-up of the business. Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst David Errington says Treasury is in a strong position with its luxury wine inventories at $474 million representing a "sizeable level of value" to be released into the market over the next three to four years. He estimates that Treasury will have double the amount of high-end luxury wines available to sell in 2015-16 compared with 2013-14. But there are issues around investor confidence in the company's ability to capture this value with solid execution, given the events of the past 12 months.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Australian winemakers might have to wait until 2015 to see a return to growth in China after Pernod Ricard, the world's second-biggest drinks company and owner of Jacob's Creek, warned sales hadn't risen since the Lunar New Year as an austerity drive and crackdown on luxury gift-giving kept glasses empty.<br/>
         <br/>The dour forecast from Pernod Ricard, whose Jacob's Creek label is the second-most imported wine into China, will likely send shockwaves through the local wine industry already ­suffering from the sting of a strong Australian dollar and downturns in traditional markets through Europe and North America.<br/>
         <br/>
Up until 2012 Chinese drinkers had been devouring Australian wine, along with iron ore and coal, but Beijing's anti-corruption drive along with a broader austerity program has smashed demand for luxury goods, from wine to Ferraris, and pinched local wine exports to the region.<br/>
         <br/>
In a much-awaited update from Pernod Ricard, the world's fourth-largest winemaker and owner of top-selling spirits brands Chivas Regal and Martell cognac, the French drinks group said it failed to see any meaningful uptick in sales since the Chinese New Year, also warning that demand in China could remain limp until 2015.<br/>
         <br/>
Its a sentiment shared by many Australian wine companies.<br/>
         <br/>
''We think the Chinese market won't improve for the next 12 months,'' said Mitchell Taylor, the managing director of Clare Valley winemaker Taylors.<br/>
         <br/>
''It certainly hasn't picked up since the Chinese New Year and I'm hearing reports of a lot of stock still in the market,'' he told Fairfax Media. ''And I'm also hearing in some of the restaurants and the on-premise venues are not as full as they previously had been.''<br/>
         <br/>
China has eclipsed traditional ­markets such as the UK and America to become the fastest-growing export market for Australian wine for ­several years, however exports dropped by 7 per cent to 33 million litres in 2013 when austerity measures curbed spending by government bodies on luxury goods such as premium imported wines.<br/>
         <br/>
In October, Treasury Wine Estates, the world's largest pure-play winemaker and owners of Penfolds and Wolf Blass, warned shareholders that consumer demand for wine in China had softened in line with souring demand for luxury products ranging from beverages to fashion.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury Wine Estates subsequently reported volume and earnings falls in China, once its biggest growth market, with first-half volumes to the Asian region down 17.6 per cent and pre-tax earnings falling 63.7 per cent to $4.9 million.<br/>
         <br/>
The China downturn also contributed a damaging profit downgrade from Treasury Wine Estates as austerity measures imposed on government officials by President Xi Jinping nudged shoppers away from ostentatious displays of wealth.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Taylor, who is also chairman of Australia's First Families of Wine, a club of 12 multi-generational family-owned wineries, said reports from his winemaker's representative in the region confirmed confidence had not returned to the sector. ''We have noticed it's still a bit patchy in China, some regions are going OK but generally there is still a bit of caution within the Chinese market,'' Mr Taylor said.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">The decision by Treasury Wine Estates to destroy six million bottles of cheap plonk in the US could not have come at a worse time for the Australian wine sector, which wants to remind the world that we make a lot of top quality wine, too.  By Simon Evans.<br/>
         <br/>Smashing millions of bottles of wine to smithereens is a messy, ear-piercing job. A steady flow of liquid snakes its way across the floor into specialised vessels and drains, staining the crushed cardboard boxes that remain on the floor. The broken glass and soggy cardboard are collected separately for recycling, each destined for new industrial uses.<br/>
         <br/>
This is the scene that has been playing out in the US since December, when the world's largest stand-alone wine company, the Melbourne-based Treasury Wine Estates, began destroying six million bottles of cheap wine worth an estimated $34 million. The unprecedented task is so mammoth that it is not expected to be finished until June. Flagged to the market last July, the demolition was triggered by a serious miscalculation of demand in the US for a raft of wines made by Treasury's Californian business which sell in the less-than-$10 price bracket. Millions of bottles with a quick use-by date had been languishing in the warehouses of hundreds of third-party liquor distributors across the US.<br/>
         <br/>
The destruction and $160 million worth of write-downs that accompanied it claimed the scalp of Treasury chief executive David Dearie, who took the fall last September for the company having so misjudged the US market. It is now squarely in the lap of a new boss at Treasury, former Coca-Cola and Kraft Foods executive Mike Clarke, who begins on March 31.<br/>
         <br/>
The situation was a potential nightmare for more than just Dearie and the Australian Stock Exchange-listed company. There were concerns it could be a branding disaster for the entire $5 billion Australian wine sector, which had been working assiduously to remind the world that, while we make a lot of good cheap wine, we also have many top-shelf labels. The most renowned of these, Penfolds Grange – a 2008 bottle of which will set you back close to $800 – is also produced by Treasury.<br/>
         <br/>
Nor would the destruction help reverse the stark drop in overall wine exports over the previous five years, which have fallen from $3 billion in 2007 to $1.85 billion in 2012. A confluence of factors has forced many Australian labels to compete on price and convenience rather than brand, discounting just to stay on shelves. These include a global grape oversupply that has only just abated, and a crowded marketplace in which an uncompetitive currency made it hard to compete with rivals from Argentina, Chile and Europe.Such wholesale destruction<br/>
         <br/>
Respected British wine writer Jancis Robinson was blunt about the Treasury decision last July. "I have been writing about wine since 1975 and I have never heard of such wholesale destruction of wine, and such a public admission that the sort of wine being produced today has such a short shelf life," she wrote. "So much for the old adage that wine improves with age. Even before this announcement, and before presumably Treasury's export volumes dwindle considerably this year, the Australian wine exporting juggernaut has been running out of steam. The strength of the Australian dollar has, of course, not helped. Chile looks set to overtake Australia in terms of total volume of wine exported – after Italy, Spain and then France – even if at a lower average price than Australia."<br/>
         <br/>
Only a few months after Treasury's shock announcement, the Winemakers' Federation of Australia, on behalf of the nation's 2500 wine companies, released a 43-point plan designed to lift the profitability and prestige of our brands offshore and at home. Premium wines enjoy better margins and thus mean greater profitability, but just as importantly, can be used to reset the tone for how the whole sector is perceived.<br/>
         <br/>
Federation president Tony D'Aloisio, owner of the premium Yarra Valley producer Oakridge Wines and a former chairman of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, says it's important to separate the premium market from the commercial one. "The fine wine market is obviously the way to set the position of Australia," he says. "The fine wine market, as it does in any other market, is the lead. It stamps the brand and the recognition." The federation believes there needs to be a broad range of tailored activities to rebuild support for Australian wine among consumers, distributors, commentators and other influential players they term "gatekeepers'' in both the domestic and international markets.<br/>
         <br/>
A report prepared for the federation by Centaurus Partners suggests that the top end of the export market held up better during the bad years from 2007 to 2012 than the hard-hit middle ground. Exports of Australian wine that retails at $30 or more fell by only 1.1 per cent to $360 million in that time. By contrast, exports of wine in the $10-$15 bracket fell by a whopping 67 per cent, from $854 million to $286 million; wine in the $15-$30 category tumbled 43 per cent from $271 million to $155 million.Pie biggest at commercial end<br/>
         <br/>
The commercial end – defined as wine priced at less than $10 – also held up better than the middle. Exports of wine retailing for less than $7 actually grew by 4 per cent to $198 million. Wines priced between $7 and $10 fell 36 per cent to $854 million. As those last two figures show, the pie is biggest at the commercial end, which helps explain why it is so difficult to shift perceptions.<br/>
         <br/>
Commercial wine production actually accounts for two-thirds of the $5 billion Australian wine industry, with our export success in this field led by Yellow Tail, produced by Griffith-based Casella Wines, and Jacob's Creek, owned by global drinks giant Pernod Ricard. They have been at the forefront of the "critter brands'' which have found success in export markets over the past decade. Other critter labels include Little Penguin, Barramundi, Black Swan, and Bear Crossing, which has a koala bear on its label.<br/>
         <br/>
Casella produces about 12 million cases of Yellow Tail annually, 95 per cent of which is exported to the US. It is not only Australia's biggest export wine; more of it is imported into the US than any brand worldwide. Yellow Tail didn't exist when the Sydney Olympics were held in 2000. But by October 2013 one billion bottles had been produced. US consumers responded to the stylised yellow-footed rock wallaby, which most Americans think is a kangaroo, on its labels.<br/>
         <br/>
The brands being destroyed by Treasury don't retail in Australia. Going by names such as Beringer, Meridian and Stone Cellars, they are made exclusively for the US market. Gaining approval for their destruction has not been without bureaucratic frustrations. The political impasse in the US last October, when President Barack Obama battled to gain clearance for his budget, temporarily froze the entire workings of the US government. The consequences flowed through to every level of the government, and caught Treasury in a web of red tape. Vital applications and paperwork sent to the US Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau sat motionless in in-trays. Without them, nothing could proceed. Complex laws around the taxation of wine and the multiple jurisdictions involved added an extra layer of difficulty, such that the destruction that was announced to the market in July took until December to begin.Penfolds Grange standard-bearer<br/>
         <br/>
Penfolds, with its flagship label Grange lauded worldwide, is a standard-bearer for Australian wine offshore. Peter Gago has been its chief winemaker for the past 12 years. He was stunned when he first heard about the stumbles of his stablemates in the US, and the fact that so much wine was being destroyed. "Shock-horror was the first reaction,'' he says. That most of it was blush-style wine with a deliberately short shelf life, similar to rosé, gave those with the spreadsheets in sales and supply planning a "stark and abrupt'' reminder of the risks associated with not staying close enough to the marketplace. But Gago doesn't believe the stain from the US destruction will spill over into the other brands owned by Treasury, nor the broader Australian industry. While there was some initial curiosity from the more educated wine professionals and those in the liquor industry when it was first announced in July, that has abated. "It's only the informed people who make the association,'' he says. "The Penfolds culture is very independent of the others.''<br/>
         <br/>
Gago believes the trail blazed by Yellow Tail, Jacob's Creek and Nottage Hill has been a plus for the industry. There are some premium producers who regard these brands as "a bit of a distraction'', but he is not one of them. "I think rather than undermine, they augment. The marketplace is very complex. The critter brands have a certain niche.'' What Australia needs to do, he argues, is a better job at explaining the sheer breadth and diversity of the wine it can produce. "The magical catchword is choice. We're preaching diversity; we're preaching choice.''<br/>
         <br/>
The clout of high-profile wine writers and the points they hand out for particular wines are crucial to raising the reputation of Australia's top wines offshore, and to this end Penfolds Grange is doing its bit. The 2008 release has been applauded around the world, receiving a perfect score of 100 points from one of the world's leading wine magazines, Wine Spectator, and similarly perfect scores from Robert Parker's highly influential Wine Advocate and the Swiss wine publication Weinzeitung.<br/>
         <br/>
These scoring systems provide a universal benchmark that everyone understands – and Gago says the 2010 Grange, out in 2015, is better still. He is relishing the prospect of releasing this vintage, which he is sure will help bolster Australia's reputation at the very upper echelons of the world of wine.<br/>
         <br/>
Robert Hill Smith is the managing director of Yalumba Wines based in South Australia's Barossa Valley. The winery reeks of history, with glorious bluestone walls, lush green lawns with a very English sensibility, set against the backdrop of rolling hills and green vineyards just outside of the historic town of Angaston. Hill Smith says patience is required in the wine sector and that those focusing on short-term investment returns are bound to run into strife. "I think that patient capital is certainly something that is a requirement for giving Australia a more credible foundation and driving its reputation around the planet.''<br/>
         <br/>
Yalumba is family-owned and doesn't have the full glare of the public spotlight on its every decision, as an ASX-listed company like Treasury does. Hill Smith says being publicly listed is perhaps not the best model for a wine company, because of the need for long-term decisions that won't necessarily deliver consistent shareholder returns.<br/>
         <br/>
He believes there needs to be a better-funded, co-ordinated approach from industry bodies to help elevate perceptions of quality overseas. A Winemakers' Federation report showed that levies paid to government agency Wine Australia to support the sector's activities dropped from $17 million to $11 million between 2007 and 2012.<br/>
         <br/>
"Those organisations are underresourced given the complexities and the compliance that is needed,'' Hill Smith says. "We have to have an income stream with sufficient substance in it that allows the industry as a whole to have a bank to promote itself.''<br/>
         <br/>
Explaining the broad geographic spread of Australia's different wine regions and what they can do is paramount to shifting perceptions offshore, argues Hill Smith, as is offering different cues to educated wine drinkers. He was impressed with the Wine Australia-backed Savour Australia event held in Adelaide in September 2013, in which food and wine were promoted together. He warns that any such marketing needs to be committed to for the long term. "The days of a one-hit wonder are long gone.''<br/>
         <br/>
Like Gago, Hill Smith believes the success of the lower-priced commercial wines such as Yellow Tail and Jacob's Creek hasn't been damaging to the broader Australian industry. Every country has inexpensive offerings that take away some of the uncertainty for an anxious consumer not sure what to pick from a shelf. "We've got to grow up and accept that every wine-making country has an introductory level.''New Zealand proves the point<br/>
         <br/>
New Zealand proves that point. Its wine industry has grown enormously on the back of its sauvignon blanc offerings, which run the gamut from entry level to more sophisticated offerings. It has very successfully parlayed the popularity of its more mainstream offerings into enticing drinkers to move up to the higher-priced luxury wines. "New Zealand has an ocean of sauvignon blanc,'' says Hill Smith. The Australian federation is trying to even the playing field, calling for changes to how a rebate is applied to this country's complicated wine equalisation tax. In essence, D'Aloisio says that 205 Kiwi wine companies selling their products in Australia shared $25 million in tax rebates in 2011-12. There's a view that they shouldn't be given a leg up to take business away from local producers.<br/>
         <br/>
Sophisticated drinkers in any market tend not to be too worried about the price tag. The trick, then, is to be among the group of labels that these drinkers are choosing from. "The more serious and considered purchases, it doesn't depend on price,'' Hill Smith says. "It's a bit more cerebral and can take a long time.''<br/>
         <br/>
Reaching the educated drinker is a tough task. The large retailers selling wine in markets such as Britain have enormous power. They want to stock brands that sell quickly, which doesn't necessarily lend itself to a high-end wine. The internet is useful in overcoming the difficulty of securing offshore shelf space, but that too has its challenges, not least of which is merely getting clicked on.<br/>
         <br/>
In the end, there is no quick fix. Vanya Cullen, managing director and chief winemaker at Cullen Wines, believes the passage of time will help advance Australia up the global wine spectrum. Ours is a young wine-making nation, particularly compared with European countries, and a proven track record is important for an individual company as well as a wine-producing nation. "It takes a long time to understand what the land can produce,'' she says.<br/>
         <br/>
A high-end producer from Western Australia's spectacular Margaret River region, Cullen's winery is nestled on fertile land close to the wild surf beaches that compete with the wine circuit for the attention of tourists. She notes that backing off on yields in favour of optimising quality into the future is an important ingredient to getting that track record. "There is that commitment to looking after the land," she says. "I don't see a lot of commitment to sustainability at the moment.''<br/>
         <br/>
Getting the message right is especially important in younger markets like China. "You go to China and it is more brand-based," Cullen says. The answer for Australia, she believes, is to build greater awareness of the different regions and what they each produce. "I do believe it is about understanding the great wine-growing sites of Australia.''</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Take a look at the top-performing stocks as measured by share price rises over the four-week reporting season and it is obvious investors are willing to pay a lot for growth. Growth is scarce in Australia because consumers remain nervous about the future and the corporate sector is holding back on capital investment.<br/>
         <br/>So when multinational pizza-maker Domino's Pizza and electrical appliances distributor Breville delivered growth in their interim results, the market responded warmly. Domino's shares have risen 26 per cent in the past month. Its interim earnings per share jumped 20 per cent on a 38 per cent rise in net profit.<br/>
         <br/>
Breville, which sells a co-branded range of Nespresso machines, saw its shares rise 19 per cent over the past month, despite the fact that earnings per share were flat at 24¢ a share in the interim period.<br/>
         <br/>
Fund managers told Chanticleer the share price could be attributed to the 23 per cent increase in the firm's core business revenue.<br/>
         <br/>
Growth was rewarded elsewhere, particularly in relation to several stocks that were listed last year through initial public offerings. Veda Group, a data analytics company, said it was on track to deliver results in line with its prospectus forecasts.<br/>
         <br/>
Fund managers said the search for growth was harder these days because of the structural forces impacting upon sectors that were traditional proxies for growth, such as the media sector.<br/>
         <br/>
A cyclical upturn in the economy would usually be reflected in higher advertising spending, which made media stocks the natural home for those seeking organic growth. Nine Entertainment Co has enjoyed a rally in its shares after delivering a solid result, while Fairfax Media appeared to rally strongly simply because it delivered what was promised.<br/>
         <br/>
One fund manager said Fairfax was in the same basket as a number of companies which enjoyed relief rallies on the back of interim profit results that did not immediately disappoint.<br/>
         <br/>
Another stock in this basket was Leighton Holdings. Its shares have risen about 15 per cent in the past three weeks despite a warning from at least one analyst that the composition of its cash flow "lacked quality".<br/>
         <br/>
A Macquarie Securities analyst said Leighton's receivables had risen by $660 million to $1.5 billion in the six months to December. This pointed to an increase in "underclaims", which relates to contract variations, scope changes and difficult terms and conditions. Leighton is the last mining services company not to have had a profit downgrade.<br/>
         <br/>
A study of the company announcements over the past month relative to analysts' forecasts found that only 22 per cent of companies missed on dividend per share, while 35 per cent missed on earnings per share and half missed on free cash flow.<br/>
         <br/>
The author of the study, Hasan Tevfik of Credit Suisse, says this shows that yield has been favoured ahead of capital investment.<br/>
         <br/>
Nevertheless, fast-growing companies that are investing for growth have been rewarded with strong share price rises, including SEEK, REA Group and G8 Education. All of these were among the top 20 performing stocks over the past month.<br/>
         <br/>
A feature of the reporting season has been the focus on cost-cutting in resources, media, aviation and mining services.<br/>
         <br/>
However, an increasing number of leading business figures are saying the cost-cutting cannot continue and the focus will have to be on growing revenue.<br/>
         <br/>
Gary Wingrove, the relatively new chief executive at professional services firm KPMG, says his clients have just about exhausted the amount of costs that can be removed from their businesses.<br/>
         <br/>
However, Grant O'Brien, chief executive of Woolworths, made it clear on Friday when he released the company's best interim results for several years that there were more efficiency gains to be extracted from its supply chain.<br/>
         <br/>
O'Brien told analysts the company would soon be able to give details of its next-generation supply chain capability. This project will be as big as the one that transformed the company more than a decade ago under former chief executive Paul Simons.<br/>
         <br/>
Investors who have not thought about putting a proportion of their superannuation savings into alternative investments ought to look at the relative performance of Australia's two largest wine companies.<br/>
         <br/>
The two companies are Accolade Wines, which owns leading brands Hardys, Houghton, Leasingham and Robert Mondavi, and Treasury Wine Estates (TWE), which owns Penfolds, Wynns, Wolf Blass and Rosemount.<br/>
         <br/>
Accolade is 80 per cent owned by CHAMP private equity on behalf of a range of investors, including sovereign wealth funds and institutional fund managers.<br/>
         <br/>
TWE is a publicly listed company that was spun out of Foster's Group as a separate listed company in May 2011.<br/>
         <br/>
The performance of TWE has been poor since it became an independent company. It has had to deal with excess inventory in its supply chain in the United States. Also, chief executive David Dearie was dumped in September last year.<br/>
         <br/>
TWE's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation have been flat over the past two years at around $280 million. Analysts at Credit Suisse say the company will have EBITDA in the year to June 2014 of $284 million and $304 million in 2015. Revenue is expected to be about $1.7 billion this year.<br/>
         <br/>
Contrast that with Accolade, which was spun out of the American premium wine and spirits company Constellation Brands in 2011. Under the guidance of CHAMP's John Haddock, Accolade will this year double its EBITDA to $100 million on revenue of about $1 billion. Accolade has been able to take advantage of its strengths, which include the largest wine volume in Australia and the largest bottling plant in Europe.<br/>
         <br/>
Haddock says the secret to the turnaround at Accolade has been the appointment of quality managers from private equity and global wine and beverage industries. Accolade's new chief executive, John Ratcliffe, who started in February, was the commercial director at UK wine merchant Oddbins.<br/>
         <br/>
TWE's new chief executive, Warwick Every-Burns, has a long experience in the fast-moving consumer goods sector.<br/>
         <br/>
Tough corporate restructuring can be more easily achieved under the ownership of private equity. There is not only a willingness to take hard decisions, but the managers have significant skin in the game and work towards goals that have no relation to the half-yearly reporting schedules of public companies.<br/>
         <br/>
A private equity investment usually lasts for about five years.<br/>
         <br/>
Sovereign wealth funds and pension plans from Australia, Canada and the US, which have very long time frames for investment, are increasingly seeking to lift their returns by accessing private equity.<br/>
         <br/>
For example, the Future Fund, which manages about $100 billion in assets, has more invested in alternative assets ($14 billion) than in Australian equities ($9.7 billion).<br/>
         <br/>
The move by Westpac Banking Corp to invest $50 million in a venture capital fund for early-stage investing is likely to be copied by its rivals.<br/>
         <br/>
The Westpac move recognises the fact that the bureaucratic culture of a major bank is not suited to finding and nurturing entrepreneurs.<br/>
         <br/>
The bank's investment in venture capital is tiny compared to its $45.6 billion in share capital and retained earnings. But it is large enough to build a portfolio of companies and provide an opportunity to own the next great disruptive technology in financial services.<br/>

              <div class="document-view__body">Treasury Wine Estates chairman Paul Rayner has defended his decision to appoint a chief executive with no wine industry experience to turn around the fortunes of the struggling maker of ­Penfolds, Wolf Blass and Lindemans.<br/>
         <br/>Treasury revealed on Thursday food manufacturing executive Mike Clarke would relocate from London to Melbourne to take up the role on March 31.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Clarke was chief executive of ­Premier Foods, a listed company in London, from 2011 to 2013. Prior to this he spent two years as the president of Kraft Foods' European business.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Clarke will receive fixed remuneration of $1.7 million, about $400,000 more than predecessor David Dearie and will get a cash payout for his 2015 ­incentives if Treasury changes hands.<br/>
         <br/>
The appointment came as Treasury revealed its worst interim earnings result since listing in 2011 as sales slumped in Australia, Asia and the US.<br/>
         <br/>
"It really does concern me that there is a lack of retailer relationship at that top end of TWE," Merrill Lynch analyst David Errington said to Mr Rayner in a heated teleconference with investors lasting nearly two hours.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Rayner, a former tobacco ­executive, strongly defended the ­decision, saying Mr Clarke spent five years based in Australia running the South Pacific and Korean operations for Coca-Cola and had also worked with retailers around the world.<br/>
         <br/>
"We did in fact have a couple of ­candidates on the short list that did have wine experience," Mr Rayner said.<br/>
         <br/>
"We thought in terms of their ­experience in success through ­delivering growth and strategic and operating excellence that Mike was very clearly the appropriate guy. We have a real heavy hitter based on his experiences in global iconic brand companies and at an extremely senior level."<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury shares have plunged 37 per cent since July, when it was forced to make an embarrassing $160 million write-down in the US because too much commercial grade wine had built up in third-party distributor warehouses.<br/>
         <br/>
The group's $106.2 million interim net profit was boosted by an $80.5 ­million tax benefit. Excluding this, ­profits halved to $25.7 million.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury's move to cut promotions with retail chains during the critical December sales period backfired. Its Australian and NZ operations suffered a 30.1 per cent slump in earning before interest, tax and the SGARA accounting standard to $24.4 million.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury maintained its full year earnings guidance for between $190 million and $210 million. Its shares closed 11¢ higher at $3.81.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Every-Burns warned Treasury's underperforming Australian business would continue to find the going tough in the second half.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Rayner hosed down suggestions Mr Clarke could look to sell its ­troublesome US business, saying one of the elements that attracted Mr Clarke to the role was the ability to work for a ­global group.<br/>
         <br/>
Earnings in Asia were sharply lower, down by $8.4 million to $4.9 million because of Chinese government ­austerity measures crimping demand.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Wine woes It is as if the founders have put a hex on the famous brand.<br/>
         <br/>Is there a Penfolds curse at work? A succession of six corporate owners of Australia's most famous wine brand over the past three decades have either been taken over or run into financial strife, and the prospects of it happening again are high.<br/>
         <br/>
It's as if the ghosts of the founders Christopher and Mary Penfold, who started the wine label in 1844, are wreaking their revenge because the wine brand has strayed so far from its ­original  purpose: a source of medicinal benefit for patients of the doctor's ­medical practice.<br/>
         <br/>
The latest custodians, Treasury Wine Estates, have earned the wrath of investment markets and the credibility of the board and management is in tatters as they battle to try and restore some confidence in the company's direction after a run of disasters. Much depends on the reception received by Treasury chairman Paul Rayner and his stand-in chief executive Warwick Every-Burns, who stepped out of the Treasury boardroom to run the company last September. They will attempt to defend their strategy on Thursday when they outline the full details of the $40 million full-year profit downgrade announced three weeks ago, as Treasury officially unveils its first-half profit results. But how long will Treasury be around in its current form?<br/>
         <br/>
The irony is that Penfolds itself is a highly profitable business and the jewel in the crown of Treasury. Penfolds is estimated to make about $180 million in profits annually. That's about three-quarters of the total profits of Treasury's sprawling wine business, which also includes the Beringer brands in the US and Wolf Blass, Rosemount, Seppelt, Lindemans and Wynns in Australia.<br/>
         <br/>
Penfolds's earnings potential in the next two years is vast as a treasure trove of up to $280 million of high-quality red wines currently maturing in barrel halls hit the market.<br/>
         <br/>
As a result, potential suitors are closely eyeing the corporate mess that Treasury has found itself in and the potential upside for a new owner. Chinese firms and private equity buyers are speculated to be those most interested.Grange halo effect is as strong as ever<br/>
         <br/>
The Penfolds brand, with a 170-year-old history, has proven very resilient over three decades of corporate ructions, having passed through six different sets of corporate owners since the early 1980s.<br/>
         <br/>
The prestige of the flagship Penfolds Grange, the latest release of which the company was selling for $785 a bottle, is a huge strength.<br/>
         <br/>
Bruce Kemp was chief executive of Southcorp Wines, a forerunner of Treasury, for most of the 1990s and is today chairman of Tasmanian wine company Pipers Brook. He says ­Penfolds has enormous cachet in the ­marketplace.<br/>
         <br/>
"It still stands out,'' Kemp says.<br/>
         <br/>
Penfolds Grange and the higher-quality Penfolds range that sits underneath it were big profit drivers in the 1990s, and two decades on, the "halo" effect is still intact. "There's a pretty big halo, and a big shadow down the line,'' Kemp says.<br/>
         <br/>
Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst David Errington has all but given up on Treasury's current board and management, saying, "if the board's focus turns to maximising shareholder returns, it will need to consider breaking the company up".<br/>
         <br/>
A break-up would result in a scramble for the best assets, with Penfolds at the top of the tree. The one possible saviour in the ongoing Treasury saga is the prospect of a new, highly respected chief executive being appointed soon. There are persistent rumours about the long-time boss of Coca-Cola Amatil's Australian operations, Warwick White, having been approached to take the job. Outgoing CCA chief executive Terry Davis, who had been the subject of speculation that he has being courted, says he has no interest in taking another chief executive role at a public company.Six owners in just three decades<br/>
         <br/>
But Penfolds has been through a lot. It's had six owners in just over three decades. In the mid-1970s Penfolds was acquired by then NSW brewer, Tooth &amp; Co, and then in the 1980s became part of corporate raider John Spalvins's Adelaide Steamship Company, which also owned Woolworths, David Jones and a host of big-name food brands including Peters ice-cream and Four'N'Twenty pies.<br/>
         <br/>
Spalvins's empire fell apart after the 1987 sharemarket crash under the weight of $7 billion in debts, and Penfolds was sold off to another beer company, SA Brewing, in 1990. SA Brewing, an ASX-listed company, changed its name to Southcorp in 1993, sold off packaging and water heater businesses, and Southcorp Wines became a stand-alone wine business.<br/>
         <br/>
It then merged with privately-owned Rosemount Wines in 2001 in what was effectively a reverse takeover, to become the world's largest wine company. But things went awry under new management and in 2005 it was taken over by Foster's Group.<br/>
         <br/>
Plans by Foster's to extract efficiencies from selling beer and wine into the same liquor retailers didn't work properly, and after further management changes, Foster's was split into two companies in 2011. The wine company was re-badged Treasury Wine Estates and in May, 2011 set sail on its new voyage as an ASX-listed debt-free wine group, with Penfolds as the biggest brand.<br/>
         <br/>
Chief executive David Dearie lasted a little over two years but was then punted by the board in September, 2013, taking the blame for $160 million in write-downs connected with the US wine operations.<br/>
         <br/>
A potential predator of Treasury will be closely eyeing the red wine inventory sitting in barrel halls at Penfolds. Bank of America Merrill Lynch believes the profit increase from the Penfolds business over the next two to three years is substantial, with Penfolds having increased inventory levels of its higher-priced wines from $50 million in 2011 to $280 million in 2013.<br/>

              <div class="document-view__body">Treasury Wine Estates, the maker of globally recognised brands like Penfolds, Lindemans and Rosemount Estate seems to be suffering from the mother of all hangovers.<br/>
         <br/>As the company's fortunes lurch from bad to worse, the drumbeat around a potential takeover grows correspondingly louder.<br/>
         <br/>
TWE's travails – its share price has slumped over 20 per cent since the start of the year, following a fourth consecutive profit warning – point up the problems of running a publicly owned wine maker.<br/>
         <br/>
Many in the industry argue delisting the organisation makes more sense but with a persistent grape glut in Australia and a poor outlook for the same market in California, which is suffering the ill effects of a drought and restricted water usage, it would seem the stock price has further to fall.<br/>
         <br/>
A number of institutional investors are bracing for further earnings downgrades and remain sceptical about a revival. Board member Warwick Every-Burns' temporary occupation of the CEO role has added to the confidence drain. All these factors make TWE a sitting duck for a takeover if the share price comes off further. Industry heavyweights argue it is an inevitability and that the strike will come sooner rather than later.<br/>
         <br/>
Given the scale of difficulties facing TWE, a host of private equity names are invoked with TPG viewed as a logical contender. The buyout firm made a mint on Beringer when it offloaded the US brand to Foster's in 2000 for $US1.5 billion ($1.65 billion), having purchased it for $US350 million in 1996. Some believe a firm of TPG's ilk would make a better fist of divesting the US business, although it's not clear whether a change to the asset structure triggers a penalty in the recent US placement notes.<br/>
         <br/>
A private equity firm would take a five to seven-year view of its investment and in that time Australia may have renegotiated more favourable trading terms with major markets like China.<br/>
         <br/>
New Zealand has a host of bilateral agreements for its wine industry and grape growers are hoping to enjoy the same zero tax terms by the time Tony Abbott's administration heads back to the polls.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Large United States fund manager Wellington Management has ploughed an extra $25 million into buying shares in the ailing wine group Treasury Wine Estates.<br/>
         <br/>Boston-based Wellington was buying up shares as other investors were bailing out late last week during the hefty share price slide of 20 per cent when Treasury revealed a $40 million profit downgrade as it came out of a trading halt.<br/>
         <br/>
Wellington is now one of Treasury's biggest shareholders after spending $5.4 million buying Treasury shares last Thursday, and then splashed out a further $19.8 million on Friday to lift its holding further, in the wake of the share price rout.<br/>
         <br/>
Wellington told the ASX early on Tuesday that it now held 5.73 per cent of Treasury Wines.<br/>
         <br/>
It comes as another large global fund manager, BlackRock Group, dipped below the 5 per cent mark which requires an entity to disclose it has become a substantial shareholder. Some of BlackRock's funds lightened their holdings in Treasury late last week, causing BlackRock to slip below the 5 per cent threshold.<br/>
         <br/>
The BlackRock holdings in Treasury have been fluctuating between slightly above 5 per cent and then dipping back below that mark on several occasions over the past couple of weeks.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury, the owner of brands including Penfolds, Wolf Blass, Lindemans, Rosemount, Seppelt and Saltram, had a bad December in 2013. Its sales and profits slid because of a new strategy around promotions and discounts, and tougher times in China.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury, under new management led by interim chief executive Warwick Every-Burns, rejected the usual strategy of participating in aggressive promotions and discount deals with big liquor chains owned by Woolworths and Coles during December, leading to a heavy drop in sales.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Treasury Wine Estates is under severe pressure to reverse a new strategy of spurning aggressive promotions and discounts with big liquor chains run by Coles and Woolworths because of the risk of further damage to profits in the next few months.<br/>
         <br/>Treasury, owner of brands including Penfolds, Lindeman's, Wolf Blass and Rosemount, had almost $600 million wiped from its market capitalisation on Thursday after revealing a $40 million profit downgrade.<br/>
         <br/>
The downgrade stemmed from a sharp slump in sales in Australia during December, and a fall-off in sales to China as government-imposed austerity measures hurt demand.<br/>
         <br/>
The shares stabilised on Friday to close steady at $3.64, after Thursday's horror 20 per cent slump.<br/>
         <br/>
Citi analyst Gino Rossi says Treasury will have no choice but to revert to its previous model of being part of the aggressive promotions and discounts to generate better sales and to secure prime spots in stores and in advertising catalogues.<br/>
         <br/>
He said: "Treasury's attempts to wind back promotions won't work as the wine segment remains too competitive.''<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Rossi says Treasury, which is being run by interim chief executive Warwick Every-Burns, who put in place a new management team in late November, "will likely revert to its old play-book" in the Australian market. He expects it will steer away from its new approach of being very disciplined on price because of the risk of losing even more sales.<br/>
         <br/>
He says the poor December results from Treasury in Australia weren't the start of anything more sinister in the Treasury portfolio but were purely a result of the management ­decision to pass up retailer's ­promotional programs.Promotional spend<br/>
         <br/>
It had come at a big cost, but he believes they can regain lost market share by reinstating its usual ­promotional spend.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury wouldn't comment on Friday on whether it will rapidly reverse its strateg. It is expected to say more about the profit stumble and how it will fix the problems when it announces its first-half profit results on February 20.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury revealed on Thursday it now expected full-year profits to be between $190 million to $210 million, down from a previous forecast of $230 million to $250 million.<br/>
         <br/>
Wine drinkers will need to wait for the pre-Easter rush for the next round of big discounts in the $20 billion liquor retailing industry, as the issue of big promotions continues to be in the spotlight.<br/>
         <br/>
Terry Georgas, who runs three Jim's Cellars liquor stores in Sydney, says December is by far the biggest month for discounts and aggressive ­promotions in the industry, with revenues generally 30 per cent higher than a normal month.<br/>
         <br/>
But the weeks leading up to Easter also generate a spike, and are a good time for consumers to pick up bargains as wine companies and other liquor producers get on the front foot again.<br/>
         <br/>
"The lead-up to Easter is where it will happen again,'' Mr Georgas said.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury wound back its promotional and discount offers in December and lifted prices on some of its under $10-a-bottle brands in a new strategy under new management.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Georgas says December is crucial in the liquor industry because of seasonal celebrations and gift-giving.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">If you are preparing to screw the cap off a robust bottle of shiraz at a barbecue this weekend or a grassy sauvignon blanc at a Saturday-night dinner party, you might like to know more about the complex wine equalisation tax (WET) that reaps more than $700 million in net tax annually in Australia.<br/>
         <br/>About 90 per cent is paid by Australia's top 20 wine companies, because the way the WET works, the more sales of wine a company makes to retailers who sell it, the more tax it pays.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury Wine Estates, for example, which has the labels Penfolds, Lindeman's, Wolf Blass, Rosemount and Wynns, and which has had a rough week with a $40 million profit downgrade, pays the most WET.<br/>
         <br/>
But it is also able to claim the maximum $500,000 WET rebate, as do more than 3000 other local claimants.<br/>
         <br/>
For a shopper strolling into a liquor store to buy a $20 bottle of wine, the WET of 29 per cent is already included in the price.<br/>
         <br/>
WET was brought in at the same time as the goods and services tax in 2000 with the "equalisation'' referring to the way the WET was supposed to maintain wine prices at similar levels to the pre-GST regime after the previous wine sales tax was scrapped.<br/>
         <br/>
A WET rebate was introduced in 2004 and the rebate was boosted to a ­maximum of $500,000 per wine ­producer in 2006.<br/>
         <br/>
For small operators with minimal sales it is a godsend because it effectively means they pay no wine tax because the $500,000 rebate cancels out what they are paying in their 29 per cent of WET on the small amount of wine they sell.<br/>
         <br/>
In practical terms, Treasury Wine Estates will soak up its $500,000 rebate in the first two or three days of each financial year, while a tiny wine producer enjoys a much greater relative benefit.<br/>
         <br/>
Former federal Treasury secretary Ken Henry was not a fan of the WET or the rebate. In his 2010 Henry Tax Review he recommended that the 13 different tax rates on different types of alcohol, including beer and spirits, be scrapped and replaced by a single flat rate based on the volume of alcohol in an alcoholic beverage. This is the classic volumetric tax that has been a political hot potato for ­decades. A volumetric tax would sharply increase the price of cheaper wine, and in particular cask wine.<br/>
         <br/>
Dr Henry warned about the risks of tax avoidance in the WET regime and particularly the risk of "double dipping'' or claiming multiple times.<br/>
         <br/>
The Rudd government subsequently decided against making any changes because of the impact on employment in rural regions where wine companies are based, and the fact that the $5 billion wine industry was going through a tough time because of a high Australian dollar and a grape oversupply. The wine industry employs about 30,000 people directly, most in country areas.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Paul Rayner has gambled on Treasury Wine Estate to survive in a crowded Australian market – and lost, writes Simon Evans.<br/>
         <br/>Paul Rayner's worst nightmare is coming true. The former tobacco executive who stepped up to become chairman of Treasury Wine Estates in September 2012, exerted clear authority a year later when he axed chief executive David Dearie in September.<br/>
         <br/>
Dearie was blamed for the sloppy inventory controls in the United States at the heart of an embarrassing profit downgrade and $160 million in writedowns that were revealed by Treasury in July, 2013. When he received his marching orders, Rayner relied on one of his own boardroom colleagues, Warwick Every-Burns, to step into the driver's seat and run the company while a long search continued to find a successor.<br/>
         <br/>
As so often happens when a board of directors takes control of a company, some of the commercial nous, gut feel for the industry and relationships with the trade may slip and suffer.<br/>
         <br/>
Rayner, a former chief operating officer of British American Tobacco Australasia and a former finance director of British American Tobacco for six years until 2008, and his right-hand man Every-Burns, a former Clorox cleaning products executive, are in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons.<br/>
         <br/>
A 20 per cent share price plunge on Thursday, after a $40 million profit downgrade in December as the Australian business hit the skids and China sales slumped as government-imposed austerity measures hurt sales of higher-priced wines, has dragged investor confidence in Treasury to rock bottom.<br/>
         <br/>
Every-Burns and Rayner quickly instit­uted a management shake-up soon after Every-Burns took over the top job on an interim basis. A simplified structure was put in place after being announced on November 27. But the troubles this time have emerged in the Australian business, which had previously been a strong performer and was a shining light in the Treasury stable. Much of the management focus has been on the serious problems in the United States, but in a perverse situation, Australia is now a trouble spot.Gambled and lost<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury has a glittering collection of wine brands in its portfolio which are the envy of rivals. They include Penfolds, Wolf Blass, Lindemans, Wynns and Rosemount. Every-Burns and Rayner have backed the power of those brands to continue to thrive in a crowded market where hundreds of brands compete for the drinkers eye on retailer's shelves.<br/>
         <br/>
They have gambled and lost. In December, sales and profits slumped badly in Australia in the crucial month of December. Treasury lifted prices on a number of brands in the commercial category of $5 to $10 a ­bottle and thumbed its nose at being part of the aggressive promotional drives and discounts with the big liquor retailers of ­Woolworths and Coles in the lead-up to Christmas.<br/>
         <br/>
It has turned into a disaster. The heat is also on Treasury in the form of a class action planned by lawyers Maurice Blackburn over last year's surprise profit downgrade in July. The latest downgrade raises more questions about management systems and disclosure. Maurice Blackburn's Ben Slade said the ­latest downgrade raised further questions about transparency in Treasury's ­operations.<br/>
         <br/>
Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst David Errington warned in late October of the dangers of focusing too much on the United States, in a note that seems to have eerily come true. He said at the time that Treasury should sell its US wine business because it would be too much of a management distraction. He added it was a "material drag'' that needed to be sold off, with the risk being that a poor-performing business might negatively influence the better performing parts.<br/>
         <br/>
Rayner has been strident in his view that the US operations are an integral part of the Treasury business and won't be offloaded.<br/>
         <br/>
However, the new element that has since been injected is the different strategy implemented by those managing the Australian business when it comes to discounting and enforcing price rises at such a difficult time in pre-Christmas trading.<br/>
         <br/>
It has simply caused mayhem. The latest share price slump wiped $590 million from the market capitalisation. It also makes Treasury much more vulnerable to an offshore predator, particularly a cashed-up buyer from China or a private equity operator eyeing a quick turnaround, just as industry conditions appear to be improving and the Australian dollar falls, making exporting wine a more profitable proposition.A bad time for the industry<br/>
         <br/>
Industry conditions have been very difficult for Australian wine companies generally over the past few years.<br/>
         <br/>
Ferrier Hodgson partner John Hart, a wine industry expert, said it should be remembered that at its heart, wine is an agricultural industry with a long lead time. For each of Australia's 2500 wine companies, whether they be large or small, it is difficult to consistently produce solid profit increases.<br/>
         <br/>
"There are long cycles,'' Mr Hart said.<br/>
         <br/>
The three to four years' lead time for vineyard plantings, the capital investment required in plant and equipment that is only being utilised for part of the year and the prospect of being tripped up by changing consumer demand for different wine varieties and styles means it is a difficult industry.<br/>
         <br/>
He cited the example of a slow wane in demand for sauvignon blanc in white wines, which means producers heavily weighted towards that variety would come under more pressure.<br/>
         <br/>
"Sauvignon blanc now seems to be going out of fashion,'' he said.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Hart said the biggest factor in the overall success of the wine industry was the Australian dollar. When the currency was trading around US50¢ more than a decade ago, Australian exports surged.<br/>
         <br/>
But when it reached parity with the US currency then rose to US$1.10 it was a substantial squeeze on margins. Combined with a grape oversupply (which has now largely diminished) there was an extended period of difficult times.<br/>
         <br/>
The Australian wine retailing market can be a fickle beast.<br/>
         <br/>
Long-time observers who throw their minds back to around 2002 will recall the flipside of being too aggressive with discounts and promotions and the problems that can bring, so perhaps Treasury management need a touch of sympathy.<br/>
         <br/>
Strangely enough, that involved some of the very brands in the spotlight now. In 2002, former Southcorp boss Keith Lambert went on a discounting rampage to try to expand market share for brands including Rosemount after Southcorp and the former privately-held Rosemount merged.<br/>
         <br/>
That too turned out to be a disaster, ­costing Lambert his job and ultimately paving the way for Southcorp to be taken over by Foster's in 2005 to form an even bigger wine business alongside the Foster's beer business.<br/>
         <br/>
For long-time Treasury shareholders who are glass half-full types, there is one interesting point to cling on to for a tiny sliver of happiness.<br/>
         <br/>
When Treasury split from former parent Foster's Group in May 2011 to become a stand-alone wine company that was largely debt-free, its share price on the first day of trading – May 9, 2011 –was $3.45.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury shares finished on Thursday at $3.64 so those who were there at the start are still in front on paper. But this will be small consolation, because Treasury has been as high as $6.47 in mid-May 2013, before its troubles began.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Treasury chairman Paul Rayner and his board are under immense pressure after a disastrous decision not to take part in the usual aggressive pre-Christmas promotional discounts with Coles and Woolworths' liquor stores triggered a sales slump and a $40 million profit downgrade.<br/>
         <br/>The sharp about-turn in strategy for the crucial month of December was one of the main reasons behind a the profit downgrade revealed on Thursday by Treasury, which has lost the confidence of the market.<br/>
         <br/>
Industry players suggested the hardest hit in the sales and profit slump in Australia were in the commercial wine segment under $10 per bottle and included brands such as Rosemount, Lindemans, Wolf Blass, Jamiesons Run and Penfolds Koonunga Hill.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury increased prices on under $10 bottled win and decided against taking part in traditional deep discounting and promotional activities with Woolworths and its liquor chains such as Dan Murphys and BWS, and Coles with its First Choice and Vintage Cellars brands, and paid the price by losing prime spots in in-store displays and in advertising catalogues.perplexed liquor retailing veterans<br/>
         <br/>
The decision to lift prices and wind back promotional discounts for such an important trading month as December has perplexed liquor retailing veterans.<br/>
         <br/>
Michael Andrewartha, who owns East End Cellars, says November and December are the strongest months of the year, and when brands need to have strong momentum. Treasury had taken a big punt that its brands would still be sought after without good promotional deals, but seriously miscalculated their clout.<br/>
         <br/>
"They certainly bet and lost,'' he said.<br/>
         <br/>
"There's a lot of strong brands out there that people shift to,''<br/>
         <br/>
A continued downturn in sales to China, where the government has implemented austerity measures to curb spending on higher-priced wines, also contributed to the Treasury downgrade. Treasury shares slumped 20 per cent after the company came out of a trading halt and revealed the extent of the profit slide, which continues a run of disasters since July 2013. The stock closed at $3.64, having opened on Thursday at $3.91. Treasury announced the $40 million profit downgrade for 2013-2014 because of a substantial drop in wine sales volumes over the Christmas period and now expects ­full-year profit to be between $190 million to $210 million, compared with the previous range of $230 million to $250 million.<br/>
         <br/>
It is also still experiencing tough times in the United States, as it continues to reduce its previously overflowing stock levels in that market by cutting back on total shipments. Treasury said it expected its first half earnings before interest, tax and the SGARA accounting standard would be between $42 million and $46 million, compared with $73.4 million a year earlier.<br/>
         <br/>
In September 2013 former Treasury chief executive David Dearie was dumped by Mr Rayner from his position in the wake of $160 million in embarrassing writedowns in the US announced in July, and a decision to destroy $34 million of bottled wine sitting in the warehouses of third-party distributors to ensure an oversupply of wine in the market didn't worsen.<br/>
         <br/>
Mr Rayner installed one of his fellow directors, Warwick Every-Burns, as interim chief executive while a global search for a new boss got under way.<br/>
         <br/>
Nielsen figures showed that Treasury's Australian business was performing strongly in the September quarter, with the Treasury brands increasing by almost 9 per cent by volume and 12 per cent by value. But this rapidly reversed. Industry players suggested Treasury's volumes may have dropped by as much as 14 per cent in December, although Treasury wasn't commenting on Thursday beyond its statement to the ASX.The steep profit downgrade added to Treasury's woes on another front where it is the subject of a proposed class action led by Maurice Blackburn Lawyers over last July's initial shock profit downgrade.<br/>
         <br/>
Maurice Blackburn managing principal Ben Slade said on Thursday that the fresh downgrade raised further questions of transparency about the company's operations.<br/>
         <br/>
It was looking closely at the implications of the new downgrade.<br/>
         <br/>
"If our investigations reveal that TWE has been less than frank with the market, our class action will be expanded to claim for the losses suffered today,'' he said.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Shanghai The wreckage of Treasury Wine Estate's China strategy can be seen on websites across the country.<br/>
         <br/>Discounting is everywhere.<br/>
         <br/>
The company's best-known brand, Penfolds, has been heavily marked down across China since November last year, as retailers attempt to clear surplus stock.<br/>
         <br/>
In its release to the Australian Securities Exchange on Thursday morning, Treasury blamed "austerity measures" imposed on government officials by President Xi Jinping.<br/>
         <br/>
Yet this is only half the story.<br/>
         <br/>
Communist Party cadres have certainly scaled back their banqueting, but Treasury also got greedy.<br/>
         <br/>
Those on the ground in China say the company, in its desperation to hit quarterly sales numbers, pushed a huge amount of product into China at the beginning of last year.<br/>
         <br/>
Even without the austerity campaign insiders say it would have been difficult to move all this stock.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury's mistake was believing its stellar 2013 financial year, where volumes rose 39 per cent in Hong Kong and China, would continue this year. Such optimism came despite plenty of evidence that the good times were over.<br/>
         <br/>
President Xi outlined his austerity drive in December 2012 and issued the guidelines for the policy in January 2013.<br/>
         <br/>
By March, when he had officially taken over as President, the policy was in full swing and sales of high-end goods had began to suffer.<br/>
         <br/>
Yet Treasury ignored the signs and believed those saying the campaign would not last long.<br/>
         <br/>
The company has a very different view now, saying the problems in the first half will continue into the second.<br/>
         <br/>
One issue for investors is why it took Treasury so long to come clean about the problems in China.<br/>
         <br/>
In September last year those selling its products were talking openly about a large surplus of stock. By November the discounting could be seen on every Chinese website.<br/>
         <br/>
But the bigger issue for Treasury is the trashing of the Penfolds brand across China.<br/>
         <br/>
Prior to this wave of discounting, China offered some the highest per-bottle margins anywhere in the world.<br/>
         <br/>
Those margins will be very hard to claw back now that consumers are accustomed to big discounts.<br/>
         <br/>
Take Rawson's Retreat. It previously sold for 228 yuan ($A43), but has been marked down 74 per cent to 59 yuan on yhd.com, a Chinese website that sells everything from groceries to electronics.<br/>
         <br/>
The lower Australian dollar will help somewhat, but is not going to make up for the massive discounts being offered.<br/>
         <br/>
At the higher-end Penfolds' Bin 138 is marked down from 3510 yuan to 825 yuan for those who buy three bottles.<br/>
         <br/>
In the mid-range, Bin 128 is being discounted by 70 per cent.<br/>
         <br/>
These prices are only marginally above those seen in Australia, despite the extra freight costs and China imposing a 48 per cent tax on wine.<br/>
         <br/>
This suggests the days of fat margins in China are over.<br/>
         <br/>
Last year Treasury said its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margin were 40.3 per cent in Asia – it does not break out figures for China.<br/>
         <br/>
This compares with 9.5 per cent in the Americas and just 6.4 per cent in Europe, Africa and the Middle East.READ NEXT: Treasury Wine reveals $40m downgrade as sales slump Chanticleer | Succession plan needed as Treasury Wine hits new low</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">The prospect of Australia's iconic wine brands Penfolds, Rosemount, Wolf Blass and Lindemans being owned by an offshore company increases with each misstep by Treasury Wine Estates.<br/>
         <br/>The steady fall in the Australian dollar is also making the prospect of an offshore buyout of the company and its prized collection of brands more appetising. A lower dollar makes Australian assets cheaper, while exports into offshore markets from the Australian brands become much more competitive.<br/>
         <br/>
There will be considerable hand-wringing should that situation eventuate – particularly when it comes to Penfolds, with its 170-year heritage and flagship status in the $5 billion Australian wine industry.<br/>
         <br/>
Investors are bracing for a hefty profit downgrade on Thursday, when Treasury outlines the extent of the damage after chairman Paul Rayner and his stand-in chief executive Warwick Every-Burns finalise their review of preliminary financial results for the December half.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury Wine Estates' previous full-year profit forecast of between $230 million and $250 million for 2013-14 is likely to be scaled back.<br/>
         <br/>
While lower numbers will hurt, the bigger problem is that investor confidence in the company will slide even further towards rock bottom.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury has essentially been run by the board since late September 2013, when former chief executive David Dearie was dumped over the $160 million in write-downs announced in July and the need to destroy $34 million of excess bottled wine in the United States.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury's director and former Clorox cleaning company executive Mr Every-Burns stepped out of the boardroom to assume CEO duties in the short term, and has been working closely with Mr Rayner since then.Exchange rate a 'double whammy'<br/>
         <br/>
There were high hopes for Treasury in May 2011, when it began life as a largely debt-free stand-alone entity after Foster's Group split its beer and wine assets into separate vehicles. Six months later the Foster's beer business was snapped up for $12 billion by global giant SAB Miller.<br/>
         <br/>
With confidence ebbing away in Treasury's board and management, offshore predators have two elements moving in their favour: a share price under pressure and a falling Australian dollar.<br/>
         <br/>
The sliding Aussie means they will have more financial clout in paying for an Australian asset, while wine exports from an Australian business will be more keenly priced on retailers' shelves overseas.<br/>
         <br/>
Stephen Harvey, chairman of Deloitte's Australian Wine Industry Group, said currency is a big factor. "It's a double whammy,'' he said.<br/>
         <br/>
"It is certainly more attractive for foreign investors to invest in the Australian industry."<br/>
         <br/>
Ironically, it was a desire by wine and tourism billionaire Bob Oatley to see Penfolds and Rosemount remaining in Australian hands that prompted the 2005 sale of his crucial 18 per cent stake in those brands' former corporate owner, Southcorp, to Foster's. This paved the way for a full takeover of Southcorp by Foster's at a time when global drinks groups were circling.<br/>
         <br/>
Penfolds is the most profitable brand in the stable and the main prize for any predator of Treasury.<br/>
         <br/>
The company went into a trading halt on Tuesday at $4.45, and was above $6 prior to July 2013 when the first round of troubles emerged.<br/>
         <br/>
It has solid wine and consumer goods experience on its board: Garry Hounsell, who is also a director of Qantas, owns wine group Toolangi Vineyards in the Yarra Valley; Peter Hearl is a former executive with the firm behind fast food brands KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut; and Michael Cheek is a former executive with US spirits giant Brown-Forman.</div>

              <div class="document-view__body">Investors in Treasury Wine Estates are bracing for another profit downgrade from the ailing wine group because of soft profit figures for December.<br/>
         <br/>Treasury was scheduled to announce its first-half results on Feb­ruary 20 but after top executives received the latest set of preliminary ­figures for December, the extent of the fall-off in the United States was enough to prompt an urgent request to the ASX for a trading halt, which has been granted until early Thursday.<br/>
         <br/>
The expected downgrade stems from a poor profit performance in December in the US market, and tougher times in Asia, where austerity measures imposed by the Chinese ­government have hit sales of higher-priced wines in China.<br/>
         <br/>
The downgrade will further damage investor confidence in Treasury, which has experienced a horrific run over the past seven months. In July 2013 it announced $160 million in write-downs related to excess wine that had built up in third-party distributors' warehouses in the US, and a shock ­decision to destroy $34 million worth of lower-end bottled wine to prevent it from heading onto retailers' shelves.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury executives and the board are currently reviewing the latest set of internal figures for the company, which sells brands including Penfolds, Wynns, Rosemount and Lindeman's.<br/>
         <br/>
December is a crucial month for wine companies because of the large percentage of sales for ­Christmas ­parties, gift-giving and ­seasonal ­celebrations.<br/>
         <br/>
Part of Treasury's strategy for dealing with its excess supply in the US was to move more shipments by discounting, but this appears to have worsened the situation for all wine companies, and this was alluded to by rival ­Constellation Brands three weeks ago.<br/>
         <br/>
Citi food and beverages analyst Gino Rossi said on Tuesday that market conditions were poor in the US.<br/>
         <br/>
"It's not a good environment to be trying to clear excess stock," he said.<br/>
         <br/>
Treasury's interim chief executive Warwick Every-Burns warned at the annual meeting on October 23 that first-half profits were expected to be "lower than prior years" because of lower ­shipments to the US and increased brand investment in Asia, but said he remained committed to a previous forecast of full-year earnings for 2013-14 of between $230 million and $250 million.</div>
