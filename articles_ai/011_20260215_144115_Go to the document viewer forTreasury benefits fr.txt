One of Treasury Wine Estate's top executives says it will continue to benefit from an oversupply of grapes in the Australian wine industry over the past 10 years.

Stuart McNab, Treasury's global supply and production manager, says the oversupply of grapes has been a plus for Treasury because it lowers input costs. He says it is likely to continue, although it is hard to predict for how long. "It's not normal to stay in oversupply for 10 years," he said.

Mr McNab says the company's strategy is to tilt towards higher-priced luxury and premium wines.

The company's vineyard self-sufficiency ratio is at about 25 per cent, which means it buys many of its grapes from outside growers. Treasury has 83 wine brands in its portfolio, including Penfolds, Wolf Blass, Rosemount, Wynns and Lindemans, and is the world's largest stand-alone stock exchange listed wine company.

He says it's difficult to forecast when supply and demand might move back into balance because of factors such as the size of grape harvests in other countries and the determination of local independent grape growers who might be running at a loss.

Mr McNab said many grape growers were reluctant to exit the industry even if they were uneconomic because there were few alternatives.

Treasury's board on Monday announced it was ending talks about a proposed $3.4 billion buyout. This came after an exhaustive due diligence process where Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and junior partner Rhone Capital, and rival bidder TPG Capital, investigated the inner workings of the company but couldn't pay what the company's major institutional shareholders wanted. Treasury shares have fallen 14.4 per cent from $4.92 since the rejection on Monday morning.

Chairman Paul Rayner said about half of its share register by aggregate didn't think a price of $5.20 per share was enough. This was despite indicative proposals made in early August by both private equity firms at the $5.20 per share mark, which allowed them to conduct due diligence.

Treasury announced on August 29 a delay of its annual meeting, expecting it would be held to coincide with a scheme of arrangement meeting in which Treasury shareholders would vote on a takeover bid.

Mr McNab said the Australian grape crush over the past few years had been averaging about 1.8 million tonnes, although there were seasonal fluctuations, and it was unusual that supply remained so high with so many grape growers making a loss. "They've stayed in production but at a much lower capital base," he said.
