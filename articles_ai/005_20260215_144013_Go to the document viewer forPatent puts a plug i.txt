Shanghai | Treasury Wine Estates' ­top-selling Penfolds brand has been removed from all InterContinental Hotels in China, amid fears those selling the wine could be liable for damages in a long-running trademark dispute.

The removal is a blow to the takeover target's China strategy and raises fears other large hotel chains, supermarkets and online stores may follow in ­suspending sales of Australia's best known wine.

InterContinental, which has 214 hotels across China, removed ­Penfolds from its wine lists last week citing legal advice.

"I would ask you to pull your ­Penfolds branded wines off your menus until further notice," Tim ­Stanhope, the director of food and ­beverage operations, said in an email to managers on July 28. "We don't want to be involved in any further law actions."

The Australian Financial Review reported on July 13 that Penfolds had failed to register its Chinese name and was now locked in a legal battle with a notorious trademark squatter to reclaim it. Penfolds said it had won an initial court case against the man, but the ruling was being appealed and the matter ongoing.

Penfolds is up against the same squatter who won a record 33.73 million yuan ($5.8 million) from French wine giant Castel, after he ­registered its Chinese name.

In a phone conversation, Mr ­Stanhope confirmed InterContinental had stopped selling Penfolds wine and said the company was being cautious.

An industry source estimated the InterContinental contract could be worth around 5000 cases annually to Penfolds or around 5 per cent of its total shipments to China.

"Do you want to take the risk of being sued or do you just find another brand to sell? Lets be frank, there are plenty of other brands," said the wine ­industry source.

The InterContinental decision comes amid a deteriorating business environment for foreign companies in China, who are increasingly being ­targeted by regulators and the state controlled media.

In recent months, United States tech firms Microsoft and Qualcomm have come under investigation for ­anti-competitive behaviour, while Apple and Starbucks have been singled out for heavy criticism in the media.

In this environment, many foreign ­business are being overly cautious.

In his email, Mr Stanhope said under Chinese law outlets which sold goods found to have infringed a trademark were also considered to be have broken the law. "Therefore in order to play it safe, it's better that hotels stop selling the wine until there is a court ­judgement announced," the email said.

This could be months if not years away as Treasury began legal action to reclaim its Chinese name, Ben Fu, in 2011.

Treasury representatives were not available for comment.

A search of China's trademarks office found three variations of ­Penfolds' Chinese name, which loosely translates to "chasing prosperity", have been registered. The last of these was approved in December 2013, more than two years after Treasury began legal action to reclaim the name.

The trademarks are held by Li Shen and Li Daozhi, both from the coastal city of Wenzhou and are thought to be related. Li Daozhi won the record­ ­trademark claim against Castel in August last year after registering the French giants Chinese name, Kasite.

He now markets his own wine under the Kasite brand in China in direct ­competition to the French wine maker.
