Former Coca-Cola Amatil chief executive Terry Davis has joined forces with private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in its $3.4 billion tilt for Treasury Wine Estates, the owner of Penfolds, Rosemount and Wolf Blass.

Mr Davis is understood to be part of the KKR and Rhone Capital buyout bid now, after initially being sounded out for his expertise by rival private equity firm Carlyle Group earlier in the ­process.

Carlyle has yet to declare its hand but is understood to be working on a potential buyout offer of its own, and may soon become the third bidder to enter the field of prospective buyers for Treasury.

The involvement of Mr Davis behind the scenes with the KKR/Rhone Capital buyout bid has been mentioned in high-level financing briefings by Macquarie, which may be involved in the financing of the KKR/Rhone offer, sources said.

KKR and Rhone have their financing package all but signed up subject to satisfactory due diligence, with firms including Credit Suisse, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Nomura all part of the syndicate.

KKR and Rhone are structuring the deal with a lower-than usual debt component for a private equity deal with debt of around $1.4 billion and equity of $2 billion.

Mr Davis ended a 13-year stint at the helm of soft drinks maker Coca-Cola Amatil earlier this year.

His name was mentioned in market speculation as a potential chief executive of Treasury in late 2013, when Treasury embarked on a global search for a new boss after the board axed former chief executive David Dearie.

Mr Dearie was sacked after an embarrassing write-down of $160 million in mid-2013 mainly related to the troubled United States business.

The job of chief executive of Treasury ultimately went to former British food industry executive Mike Clarke, who started on March 31 and has quickly formulated plans to try to revive Treasury's fortunes.

They centre on stepping up investment in the marketing behind high-end brands like Penfolds and Wynns and stripping out back-office costs.

Also on Tuesday, Wolf Blass, the man behind one of Treasury's most successful international brands, said whoever ends up buying the company needs to quickly sell off the ailing US operations because it has been a "nightmare from day one''.

Mr Blass, who is still part of the Treasury stable as an "ambassador'' for the Wolf Blass brand, said he has been telling the board for years it needed to sell the US business because it was such a drain on return on investment, but it refused to listen.

"America has been a nightmare from day one,'' Mr Blass said.

He also said if either private equity bidder, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, or TPG Capital, gains control of Treasury, they should do likewise and offload the US business.

But he warns that any move by new private equity owners to make short-term decisions with the broader ­Treasury business would have a ­harmful impact on the entire Australian wine industry.

"That could be harmful if they're in it for a fast buck,'' he said.

TPG Capital emerged as a second bidder for Treasury on Monday with a proposal pitched at $5.20 a share, valuing the company at $3.4 billion.

This was the same as a buyout ­proposal lodged by KKR/Rhone a week earlier.

Mr Blass is a pioneer of the Austra­lian wine industry and listed his eponymous company on the stock exchange in the early 1980s before it merged with another company to form Mildara Blass.

Mildara Blass was then bought out by beer company Foster's Group in 1996 in its first entry into the wine industry.

Mr Blass is 79 and said he is "firing on all cylinders". He travels regularly for Treasury to promote the Wolf Blass brand, which generates 70 per cent of its sales overseas.

He said the strategy by new Treasury chief executive Mike Clarke to trim the brand portfolio from the current 83 brands is smart, because it is too many for all the brands to thrive.

"It's a lunatic situation,'' Mr Blass said.

But he is concerned that the work under way to trim the portfolio might be disrupted by the due diligence process as the US predators scrutinise the inner workings of the company.

"It is interrupting how to split them up and where to go from here,'' he said.

Mr Blass said he cautioned the ­Foster's board against buying Beringer in the United States for $2.9 billion in 2000.

"This is going to be the greatest disaster you've ever made,'' Mr Blass warned them.

He said he doesn't own any Treasury shares, and the biggest mistake that Foster's and Treasury have made in the United States is not having strong ­Australian management running that business.

He has high regard for the abilities of Mr Davis, and the private equity bidders will benefit from his expertise.

Mr Davis was managing director of Foster's wine operations when it bought Beringer in California in 2000.

The purchase has since proven to be a major reason for Treasury's fall from grace.
