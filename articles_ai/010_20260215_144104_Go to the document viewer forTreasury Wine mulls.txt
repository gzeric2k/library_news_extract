Treasury Wine Estates is considering acquiring a United States business to give it access to a sustainable supply of quality grapes to try and bolster a revival, as part of the company's long term growth strategy.

Chief executive Michael Clarke said it had a list of companies it was considering acquiring which would give it access to the best grapes.

"If we could get access to more luxury and masstige, i.e. top end grapes, that would allow us to even further step-change our growth rate in the luxury masstige part of the portfolio in North America and outside of North America," he said.

"The spot market works very well with commercial wine . . . but to get a regular supply of luxury masstige grapes on the spot market is very difficult . . . everyone is looking to get access to those grapes,'' he said after the Treasury annual meeting in Melbourne on Tuesday. Masstige is an industry term for a brand which sits between prestige and mass market.

Mr Clarke said he was not interested in taking on any new brands, he only wanted access to the grapes.

"I'm not looking to buy a business that gives us brands, I'm not looking to buy a business that gives us infrastructure – we have that," he said.

He also signalled that Treasury was close to finalising some changes in the lower end of the troublesome United States business, where it would slim down its commercial brand portfolio.

"We are exploring some imminent opportunities to address the non-priority commercial brand portfolio," he said. This segment in the US represents between one to two million cases of lower-priced wines for Treasury, which he described as a "significant drag on our core portfolio''.

He would not elaborate on which brands were on the chopping block, but said they would be wines under the $US3 ($3.70) price point.

Mr Clarke also outlined that of Treasury's 80-plus brands, about 15 have the potential to be what he calls "global umbrella brands" capable of being solid performers on the world stage.

Mr Clarke, a former chief executive of British food group Premier Foods, was appointed to the top job on March 31, and has largely been applauded by shareholders for the changes he has made. The wine company's financial performance for the first half of 2014-15 is "on plan and ahead of prior year'', Mr Clarke told shareholders, as his fix-it plans and reinvestment in the business continue to bite.

Mr Clarke said the solid progress in the first five-and-a-half months of the first half had been driven by the switch of the release of high-end Penfolds wines to October from the previous May 1 date, and reinvestment behind the major wine brands.

Mr Clarke said he was "very pleased" by the release date switch.

"By moving it to October it allows us to capture those gifting occasions . . . and it's definitely happening around the world," he said. "In prior years we would release Penfolds in March and May which would result in them trying to sell as much Penfolds as they could in the last quarter of the financial year. That I felt was damaging the brand."

Treasury chairman Paul Rayner told shareholders he believed the board had done the right thing in terminating talks with private equity bidders earlier this year, with "clear feedback" from almost every major shareholder that a price of $5.20 per share undervalued the company.

"I am confident that [what] we did was right at every step of the process,'' Mr Rayner said.

Treasury Wine's annual meeting is usually held in late October but was rescheduled months ago on the expectation it would coincide with a shareholder vote on one of the two private equity takeover proposals the company had received.

But the Treasury board on September 29 announced that it had ended talks with private equity suitors about a proposed $3.4 billion buy out after months of due diligence.

Treasury shares closed down 4.56 per cent at $4.40 on Tuesday.
