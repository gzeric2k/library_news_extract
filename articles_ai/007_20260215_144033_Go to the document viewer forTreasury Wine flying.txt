Treasury Wine Estates is going completely against the trend, as the wider sharemarket inexorably grinds lower and lower.

While the Free Trade Agreement with China is a fillip, with tariffs of between 14 to 20 per cent for wines sold in China to be removed over four years, there's also plenty going on internally as chief executive Mike Clarke steps up his push to get the balance sheet working harder.

The bulging portfolio of 83 brands might be getting a snip soon as Clarke nears decisions on what part of the long tail will be offloaded.

Question marks hang over the likes of brands like Robertson's Well out of the Coonawarra and the old stager from the Barossa Valley, Tollana.

Treasury shares climbed another 1.3 per cent on Wednesday, adding to the 2.7 per cent it put on in the post FTA announcement glow.

Clarke wants to pile even more funds behind brand-building and marketing because he is a firm believer that's where the game is won or lost.

The number-crunchers are thought to be working on some sale and leaseback deals for infrastructure assets as part of a sharper focus on capital intensity.

Treasury shares are now sitting at $4.70.

That's bang on the same price that private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts came through the door with, almost six months ago with its first indicative proposal.

It was upped to $5.20, with the help of Rhone Capital, and of course TPG then came into the ring at $5.20 per share. But in the end neither could make it work at that price. Was the prospect of a FTA with China factored into the future cash flow projections?

The big conundrum for investors is whether the private equity firms might have another shot next year.

Clarke is also grappling with internal upheaval after a big cost-cutting program which hooked out 175 employees mid-year, and the fallout that follows from a big cultural change.

There are no sacred cows though, as evidenced by the decision to shut the Ryecroft winery in McLaren Vale and shift production to the bigger Wolf Blass site.

TWE's two largest customers in Australia, Coles and Woolworths, are both following strategies of increasing levelsof In-House brands, putting pressure on both TWE Commercial and Premium wines.

Tollana is one of the Treasury Wine brands under review.
