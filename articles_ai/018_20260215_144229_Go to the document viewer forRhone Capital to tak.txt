Rhone Capital principal Robert Agostinelli is an accountant by trade and even though he's among the richest 400 people in the US these days with $1 billion-plus, he still has an eye for how to structure the finer details of a deal.

Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Rhone have come up with a nifty framework it seems to get around any concerns that US anti-trust regulators might have with the US aspect of the joint buy-out of Treasury Wine Estates.

The thorn is the US-based Beringer wine business. In the proposed ownership structure, it is likely that Rhone will become the official owner of the US wine operations under one of the Rhone funds, as part of the broader KKR/Rhone takeover of Treasury.

This is a necessity because of the existing real estate platform run by Ralph Rosenberg that KKR owns amongst its other extensive investments in the US.

It is all connected with the complicated rules around tied house distribution for hotels and bars that exists in the US for suppliers of alcohol which prevent KKR from owning the US wine business outright as well as the real estate interests. Raft of laws

Blame Al Capone and the days of Prohibition when the wowsers put in place some tough laws that continue today which also mean that beer and wine producers can't sell directly to retailers but have to go through third-party distributors. There's a raft of different laws in different states that are enough to drive an investment banker to drink.

It also appears that KKR's Asian fund will own the rest of the Treasury operations. Treasury shares slipped a bit on Wednesday by 6¢ to $5.11, well shy of the $5.20 offer.

French conglomerate Pernod Ricard may be a chance to pick up the US business much further down the track if KKR/Rhone decide to flick it off, but Constellation Brands is already loaded up with debt and is a no-show.

Plus, it is still smarting from its experiences in the early 2000s when it bought BRL Hardy at the top of the market for $1.9 billion and watched most of that value get frittered away as the Australian dollar rose and the glory days of cheap plonk exports to the UK and US disappeared.

Constellation still has 20 per cent of what is now known as Accolade Wines, with CHAMP Private Equity holding the other big chunk.

Elsewhere, and as revealed by Street Talk Online, Mark Malouf will be sole head of JPMorgan's Australasian equities business after Richard "Spider" Newton joined the equities syndicate team this week.
