Might it be that the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan or another of TPG's deep-pocketed investors picks up part-ownership of Treasury Wine Estates's US wine business, Beringer? 

TPG is working on scenarios to skirt potential problems its Treasury bid may encounter with US gaming regulators. TPG has a large stake in casino operator Caesars Entertainment and under the country's ancient "tied house'' regulations, there are strict controls on the ownership structures of companies involved in the supply of alcohol to hotels, bars and entertainment venues. (Rival Treasury suitor KKR brought in Rhone Capital to take Beringer and resolve the issue.)

One theory is that TPG may be working with one or more of its long-standing limited partners to get around the issue, with TPG fronting the bid. It is possible TPG may not be injecting much capital itself if it is successful in a buyout of Treasury and that in the United States, a pension fund or investment fund would be the entity that actually owns the US business.

As always when it comes to private equity funds, it's all in the structuring.

TPG has form when it comes to ­co-investing with its key limited partners. When it bought UGL's property arm DTZ in June, both OTPP and Asian heavyweight Pacific Alliance Group cut hefty equity cheques for a piece of the deal.

Treasury shares drifted lower again on Wednesday to slip by 13¢ to $5.11. That's below the $5.20 price offered by both KKR and Rhone, and TPG.

Whatever transpires, this one will take a lot of time to cement given it's through a scheme of arrangement where shareholders have to vote if a clear proposal is agreed.

It may well be close to December before it could all be finalised, now that there are two parties under the bonnet fumbling around with Treasury boss Mike Clarke's inner workings.

Still no word too on how long the "period of time'' of anonymity requested by the second bidder, which everyone is assuming is TPG, might extend for. Full disclosure anyone?
