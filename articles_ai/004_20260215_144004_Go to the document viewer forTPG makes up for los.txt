It started a week behind, but private equity firm TPG Capital is setting a blistering pace on due diligence at Treasury Wine Estates.

It's been a whirlwind five days of management sessions as TPG puts the hammer down on what is shaping as a very serious proposal.

It is pushing hard to pull the rug out from under the original bidder, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, and its junior equity investor, Rhone Capital.

TPG – which, in a slightly cute way, is still referred to in official circles as an "unnamed" party in the whole chase for the owner of Penfolds, Beringer, Wolf Blass, Rosemount and Lindeman's – came into the ring on August 11, a week after KKR and Rhone went into the tent after lifting the buyout proposal to $5.20 a share.

So what has TPG been doing?

Some vigorous sessions with TWE management have been undertaken: one in California's Napa Valley where, thankfully, the earthquake didn't cause too much damage, three full-on days with Treasury management in the Melbourne headquarters, and one in the Barossa Valley in South Australia, at the biggish wineries and vineyards.

TPG's United States boffins were all over the US assets and are right behind the push by Treasury chief executive Mike Clarke to pick up some extra luxury wine assets, but only in a small way.

TPG is very keen on Clarke as the man to take the company forward.

Former Coca-Cola boss Terry Davis is still closely linked to the KKR / Rhone proposal, but there are mumblings in the market that Davis may not have the cosiest relationship with Treasury's biggest customer, Woolworths.

Woolworths, which of course unveils its own full-year results on Friday, runs Dan Murphy's, BWS and a big portfolio of pubs with gaming magnate Bruce Mathieson.

So being in sweet with it seems to be a prerequisite for any big supplier of beer, wine or spirits. TPG has all its ducks in a row when it comes to financing and number-crunching.

On the financing front, TPG has JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley, the Credit Agricole unit Calyon and HSBC in its corner.

JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank are understood to be the investment banks guiding TPG through the barrel halls full of good Penfolds red and top-end Wolf Blass grog.

At the more boring end, PwC is doing the accounting mumbo-jumbo.

But KKR / Rhone hasn't exactly been idle, either. It had a serious meeting on the financing front on Thursday.

TPG will hold its meeting with the banks in the next seven to 10 days.

Clarke is having a few well-earned days off after a ferocious few months where a buyout proposal was lobbed just weeks after he put his feet under the desk on March 31 at Treasury's Melbourne headquarters for the first time.
