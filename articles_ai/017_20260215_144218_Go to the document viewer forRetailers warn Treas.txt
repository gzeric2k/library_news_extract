Liquor retailers say the prospect of Treasury Wine Estates' portfolio of 80-plus brands being owned by an ­overseas company is unlikely to produce a customer backlash, unless price rises are pursued by new private equity owners.

Dean Taylor, the chief executive of Cracka Wines, one of Australia's biggest online wine retailers, said on Wednesday the portfolio of brands owned by Treasury including Penfolds, Rosemounts, Wynns, Saltram and Wolf Blass, had been through so many ownership changes in the past two decades that another one won't change customer perceptions.

But what customers would be closely monitoring would be any attempt to lift prices, or change the quality. "That would upset them,'' Mr Taylor said. "There is an element of our customer base who would care about foreign ownership but for most people it would be any change in quality or price that is the major factor.''

Mr Taylor said while the Treasury brands had a large presence in the Australian market, there was little evidence that customers were truly passionate about most of them.

"There's aren't a lot of customers that are brand advocates,'' he said.

United States private equity firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and junior partner Rhone Capital made a higher buyout proposal for Treasury on ­Monday pitched at $5.20 a share, which valued the company at $3.4 billion. This was 50¢ higher than a solo ­proposal made by KKR in mid-April at $4.70 a share.

The Treasury board has agreed to let the duo in to undertake due diligence on a "non-exclusive'' basis, which leaves the door open for any rival bidders.

One of the brands which new Treasury chief executive Mike Clarke is trying to super-charge by putting much more marketing spending behind it is the Wynns brand from the Coonawarra district in south-east South Australia.

Mr Taylor said he agreed with the attempt to lift Wynns higher, but pointed to a period in the early 2000s after a merger between former owner Southcorp and the Rosemount company that was then owned by the Oatley family, when Wynns was heavily discounted and the brand damaged.

"Wynns probably deserves to sit a lot higher in the hierarchy,'' he said.Customers indifferent

David Reberger, the general manager of Kemenys, which runs a substantial online business along with a large retail outlet in Bondi, said he didn't think customers would be too concerned about famous wine brands like Penfolds being owned by US-based private equity firms.

"I believe that customers are indifferent,'' he said.

They tend to follow individual brands and aren't generally perturbed about the ultimate owner of the company, he said.

Mr Reberger said Treasury and its previous incarnation, the wine division of Foster's Group, had pushed too hard in driving up the price of the Wynns portfolio over the past five years or so.

"There's only so far you can push it in Australia," he said.

But he said the Wynns brand does have much more potential in offshore markets, and perhaps hadn't been marketed as well as it could have been.

"I think that's a brand that's got a lot more potential,'' he said.

Cameron Kidd, the owner of Rathdowne Cellars in North Carlton in Melbourne, said company ownership was largely irrelevant in the purchasing decision by a buyer, with quality and value at the forefront. He believed a change in ownership wouldn't filter down to the average wine buyer.

"I would say that most of our customers don't care which company owns a brand,'' he said.

But there were exceptions. There had been a major backlash against the Tamar Ridge brand in the late 2000s when it was still owned by timber company Gunns, which was in the spotlight over environmental issues in Tasmania related to a proposed pulp mill.

"There was a huge backlash,'' Mr Kidd said.

Tamar Ridge was sold by Gunns in 2010 to Victorian company Brown Brothers.

United States drinks giant Constellation Brands, which still owns 20 per cent of Accolade Wines, the local firm which owns brands such as Hardys and Leasingham, is considered unlikely to mount a rival bid for Treasury.

Constellation's vice-president of communications, Cheryl Gossin, said from New York the company "does not comment on rumour or speculation''.
