Equity It may be time for the winemaker to free itself from the pressures of the sharemarket.

The Australian executive who once ran the world's biggest wine business has clear views on the best prospects for the resurrection of Penfolds owner ­Treasury Wine Estates: shareholders should take the money and run.

Stephen Millar, who ran the global wine operations of Constellation Brands for three years until 2006, says being a public company isn't the right place for Treasury in its current state.

He says it should hand over the keys to the United States private equity firms led by KKR & Co, who've made an enhanced $3.4 billion ­takeover bid and let them fix it up, away from the ­spotlight of being listed on the Australian Securities Exchange. "There is no doubt that if a business needs strategic changes, resurrecting, and has some challenges, then it is harder because you're needing to ­satisfy the institutional investors all the time," he says.

That is the same argument KKR and its junior partner Rhone Capital are mounting. They are trying to convince the Treasury board to hand over ­ownership of the business, which owns 83 wine brands led by Penfolds, ­Rosemount, Wolf Blass, Lindemans, Saltram and Wynns. KKR and Rhone have offered $5.20 a share for Treasury, up from KKR's initial solo proposal of mid-April of $4.70 a share.

Millar emphasises he owns no Treasury shares himself and has no axe to grind, despite having been a fierce competitors to Penfolds and its­ ­stablemates for more than a decade when he ran BRL Hardy until 2003. BRL Hardy's brands including Hardys, Leasingham, Houghton and Brookland Valley are now owned by another private equity firm, CHAMP, and the company is now known as Accolade Wines. Constellation still holds 20 per cent, but itself had a rough time after the buy out in delivering good returns as the Australian dollar rose sharply, making it hard for wine exports from Australia.State of business

Timing is everything. BRL Hardy was the poster child of the Australian wine industry in its halcyon days, with Mr Millar taking it from a $100 million company in 1992 to a $1.9 billion buyout bonanza for shareholders in 2003.

"The timing was right," he says.

He says BRL Hardy needed capital to grow and public funding was the best source at the time. But Treasury is in a far different position, having been through a string of owners with different strategies who've been trying to use its size and clout to make headway.

KKR and Rhone, who has a ­co-founder in Robert Agostinelli, who once tried to buy out the Liverpool ­Football Club in England's Premier League soccer competition in 2010, want to overhaul the Treasury business and argue it will be best done without ­having to deliver half-year and full-year profit expectations without a slip-up.

"A lot depends on the state of the business," Millar says.

There were 20 ASX-listed wine ­companies and wine investment funds in the late 1990s and early 2000s but the public company funding model is now largely out of favour in the industry, with few remaining.

Investments take a long time to bring payback because of the long lead times in an agricultural industry. Under ­private ownership "you will get time for that to pay off", Millar says.

KKR and Rhone will be paying ­special attention to the US operations of Treasury over the next few weeks as they undertake due diligence on the inner workings of the business.

It is the US where Treasury and its previous owner, Foster's Group, have blown $2 billion of shareholders funds over more than a decade.

Foster's bought the Beringer wine business for $2.9 billion in 2000 in a grand ­expansion plan, but analysts now believe the US operations are worth only about $1 billion.Management is key

KKR and Rhone and their advisers will be having long chats with the likes of Southern Wine and Spirits, the ­largest wine and spirits distributor in the US which operates in 35 States. The Miami-based group was one of those left with mountains of cheap bottled wine from Treasury's US wineries in its ­warehouses when Treasury miscalculated its supply and demand. It led to the ­infamous decision in mid-2013 by Treasury to destroy 6 million bottles of wine from warehouses across the country to rid itself of the excess supply.

Treasury was split off from Foster's as a stand-alone wine company in May, 2011 and on its first day of trading on the ASX its share price was $3.45. It had fluctuated, but by May, 2013 it had soared to $6.47. It had always been earmarked as a takeover target but a series of mishaps in the US mainly, caused the share price to plunge and opened the door for offshore raiders such as KKR.

Millar says it is important for any new owner to get the strategy right, and being owned by offshore companies won't be an issue.

"It really doesn't matter whether the owners are American, English or French, it's the quality of the management and getting those strategic decisions right. Management is the key".
