High-flying US billionaire out to improve his cellar

Robert Agostinelli, one of the principals of Rhone Group, which has linked up with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts to make a higher bid for Penfolds owner Treasury Wine Estates, has always aimed high.

Mr Agostinelli, a US billionaire who set up the Rhone ­private equity firm with Steven ­Langman in the mid-1990s, once tried to buy Liverpool Football Club in Britain when it was in financial distress in 2010.

The flamboyant 61-year-old moves in distinguished circles and is friends with former presidents George Bush and Nicolas Sarkozy.

He also has an extensive wine ­collection and has long been familiar with the global prestige of the Penfolds brand. Rhone also holds a stake in Quiksilver, the Australian ­surfwear brand headquartered in California.

Mr Agostinelli has always had an eye for a deal and even though based in New York, he has strong connections in London, built when he worked in mergers and acquisitions for Goldman Sachs in the 1980s before ­joining Lazard. Goldman Sachs in ­Australia has been bunkered down with Treasury Wine Estates in defending it from offers.

KKR is still very much the driver in the increased bid for Treasury revealed on Monday morning, which values the wine group at $3.4 billion, with Rhone the junior partner. Based on the size of the respective funds, it is likely Rhone will end up with a stake of 15 to 20 per cent, with KKR's investment funds holding the bulk of Treasury. It is believed final negotiations about the make up of the respective stakes in the bidding vehicle are still being finalised.Liverpool bid

Rhone Capital's tilt for a 40 per cent chunk of Liverpool FC in 2010 brought Mr Agostinelli fully into the public ­spotlight in the northern hemisphere.

Liverpool was one of the most successful football clubs in Britain's P­remier League. It's finances were in disarray after debt levels got too high and Mr Agostinelli and his Rhone ­colleagues made a buyout offer for 40 per cent of the club.

After months of intrigue and counter proposals, Liverpool directors put the club up for sale. It was bought by Fenway Sports Group. Liverpool FC is among the world's biggest sporting clubs brands, say global experts such as US business publication Forbes, but it sits below fellow UK Premier League club Manchester United, and Spanish club Real Madrid in the value stakes.

Mr Langman also once worked at Lazard before he and Mr Agostinelli established Rhone.

Mr Agostinelli has also been in the spotlight in Britain's papers over a court battle with his former fiancee, ­Charlotte Lucas, as he used legal avenues to demand the return of an expensive engagement ring he bought her in 2007. The legal battle hit the headlines earlier this year after their six-year ­relationship ended.

A successful takeover of Treasury in conjunction with KKR would mark the first direct investment in Australia by Rhone, although it owns companies with headquarters in overseas ­countries that have local operations in Australia, such as Quiksilver.

It has also just sold out of an investment in the global cosmetics, perfume and beauty products company Coty.
