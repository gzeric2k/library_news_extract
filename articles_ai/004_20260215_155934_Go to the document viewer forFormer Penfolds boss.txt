John Spalvins, one of Australia's best-known corporate raiders from the 1980s, whose company once owned the famous Penfolds wine brand for 10 years, has launched a blistering attack against the management of Treasury Wine Estates, and Foster's Group before it. Mr Spalvins blamed poor management of Penfolds and its stablemates over the past decade and boards of directors who, he says, "did not adequately understand the wine industry" for the situation where Penfolds appears likely to fall into foreign hands.

"From Australia's point of view it is regrettable to see ownership of major industries pass to foreign hands, particularly an icon such as Penfolds."

Mr Spalvins said Penfolds had a higher market share in Australia in the 1980s when it was under the control of his once-mighty Adelaide Steamship Co than it does now. United States private equity firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and junior partner Rhone Capital made an increased buyout bid for Treasury a week ago, valuing the company at $3.4 billion. Mr Spalvins said Penfolds' market share had diminished in Australia for one reason: "The short answer is management."

Mr Spalvins's strident views about Australian's wine industry, and in particular the management of Penfolds, will no doubt draw criticism themselves because of the way in Mr Spalvins's own company collapsed in 1991 under debt levels of $7 billion. Out of the ashes of Adelaide Steamship, which at the time included Woolworths, David Jones and a string of large food brands, some of Australia's strongest businesses have emerged. Woolworths has grown into a supermarket giant with a market capitalisation of $45 billion.

Mr Spalvins was also scathing about the attempts by Foster's Group to manage such a large stable of wine brands prior to Treasury splitting off as a stand-alone wine company in mid-2011.

Having Penfolds sitting alongside a string of other big wine brands such as Rosemount, Lindemans, Wolf Blass, Seppelt and Saltram made it very difficult, and there was an "inability to manage a large number of brands".Expensive and disastrous

Mr Spalvins said the 2000 acquisition of Beringer Wine Estates in California was expensive and disastrous.

He said both Foster's and Treasury appeared to have boards of directors "who did not adequately understand the wine industry". It was a tough business in which to make profits consistently because of the cyclical factors involved in an agricultural industry, but adequate returns would come from well-managed businesses.

"Without a doubt the industry has a large cyclical factor and investment of capital must be carefully monitored, but adequate returns can be earned if marketing and promotion of brands is correctly handled and capital not wasted," he said.

Mr Spalvins, who does not own any Treasury shares, said there were many examples of premium wine companies in the United States delivering solid returns. He said Treasury, because of its size, had the advantage of large-scale production and marketing, but had failed to earn adequate returns.

KKR and Rhone have offered $5.20 a share for Treasury, up from a $4.70-a-share proposal made by KKR alone in mid-April. "Purely from a financial point of view the shareholders should accept; the track record of current management does not justify a higher price," Mr Spalvins said.

He was speaking from the United States, where he is travelling. He is 78 and lives in the affluent Adelaide suburb of Springfield, and said he still gains pleasure seeing the high-end Penfolds wines on wine lists around the globe.

He said interest rates of 18 per cent and higher in the late 1980s that brought the highly leveraged Adelaide Steamship empire down were ultimately too hard to manage. Australia's big conglomerates now, such as Wesfarmers, were doing a fine job, but it was easier to manage debt levels with current interest rates of 5 per cent or so.

Mr Spalvins said he does look back with frustration at the strong businesses inside Adelaide Steamship that have gone on to be valued very highly by the sharemarket, and the inability of the company to hold them all together.

"Yes, it is frustrating to think of what could have been," he said.

Adelaide Steamship took ownership of Penfolds in 1980 when it bought the broader brewing business of Tooth & Co, but sold it to SA Brewing in 1990 as part of a drawn asset-sale program forced on it by bankers.
