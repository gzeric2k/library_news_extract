Treasury Wine Estates, the maker of globally recognised brands like Penfolds, Lindemans and Rosemount Estate seems to be suffering from the mother of all hangovers.

As the company's fortunes lurch from bad to worse, the drumbeat around a potential takeover grows correspondingly louder.

TWE's travails – its share price has slumped over 20 per cent since the start of the year, following a fourth consecutive profit warning – point up the problems of running a publicly owned wine maker.

Many in the industry argue delisting the organisation makes more sense but with a persistent grape glut in Australia and a poor outlook for the same market in California, which is suffering the ill effects of a drought and restricted water usage, it would seem the stock price has further to fall.

A number of institutional investors are bracing for further earnings downgrades and remain sceptical about a revival. Board member Warwick Every-Burns' temporary occupation of the CEO role has added to the confidence drain. All these factors make TWE a sitting duck for a takeover if the share price comes off further. Industry heavyweights argue it is an inevitability and that the strike will come sooner rather than later.

Given the scale of difficulties facing TWE, a host of private equity names are invoked with TPG viewed as a logical contender. The buyout firm made a mint on Beringer when it offloaded the US brand to Foster's in 2000 for $US1.5 billion ($1.65 billion), having purchased it for $US350 million in 1996. Some believe a firm of TPG's ilk would make a better fist of divesting the US business, although it's not clear whether a change to the asset structure triggers a penalty in the recent US placement notes.

A private equity firm would take a five to seven-year view of its investment and in that time Australia may have renegotiated more favourable trading terms with major markets like China.

New Zealand has a host of bilateral agreements for its wine industry and grape growers are hoping to enjoy the same zero tax terms by the time Tony Abbott's administration heads back to the polls.
