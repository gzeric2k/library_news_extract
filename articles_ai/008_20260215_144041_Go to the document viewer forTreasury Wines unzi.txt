Treasury Wine Estates chief executive Mike Clarke and one of his senior ­executives are assessing up to five ­different options before making a final decision on an internal structure likely to include a separate sales and marketing arm for the company's top-end wine brands.

They are aggressively moving to "unzip" them from the more commercial wine brands, which will also have a dedicated sales and marketing force which is likely to be in place by the end of the year.

Treasury has also singled out several commercial brands in its troubled United States operations as "non-priority'' but won't divulge which ones they are, as it attempts to move higher up the value chain and divert more investment into the luxury end of the market. The non-priority lower-priced brands may be sold, or funnelled into a joint venture structure.

Mr Clarke is working closely with the general manager of Treasury's Australian and New Zealand operations, Angus McPherson, on what Mr Clarke terms the unzipping project to put more grunt behind the higher-priced wine brands and obtain better returns from the commercial portfolio.

The initial separation will be confined to the Australian market and some of the commercial brands in the United States, but then broaden out across the entire US operations.

The duo are assessing a number of different models for the structure internally, with a separate sales and marketing unit devoted to brands like Penfolds, Wynns and the higher-priced Wolf Blass labels, and one for the commercial brands.

Mr Clarke has been holding a series of "town hall''-style meetings in Melbourne with Treasury staff over the past 48 hours along with phone briefings for the major Treasury overseas offices following the announcement by the board that it had ended talks with private equity suitors about a proposed buyout after months of due diligence.

Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, with junior partner Rhone Capital, got closest to an indicative $5.20 per share value in final proposals last Friday, but TPG Capital was some way lower. Treasury shares slipped further on Tuesday to close 5.8 per cent lower at $4.24. It has lost 14 per cent in value since Monday morning in the wake of decision announced by chairman Paul Rayner that many of Treasury's large institutional shareholders believed $5.20 per share undervalued the company.

The structural changes inside Treasury are part of Mr Clarke's fix-it plans after a series of heavy write-downs and profit downgrades over the past few years prior to his arrival on March 31. The Penfolds brand in particular will receive more investment spending to try and turn it into a global luxury brand, while the release date of new vintages for the flagship Grange and other high-priced Penfolds labels is being switched to mid-October to cash in on the pre-Christmas market.

Credit Suisse analyst Larry Gandler said the reason the buyout transaction failed "was because there was no silver bullet to unlock significant value and rapidly retire debt or partially fund the transaction''.

UBS analyst Craig Stafford has a 12-month price target of $4.33 on Treasury and recommends investors sell.

No silver bullet

Reasons the private equity deal failed

Divesting brands probably could not realise significant value because of their low margin or declining revenue profile. (Rosemount or Lindemans, for example.)

Divesting geographies such as US probably would have resulted in complex licensing and distribution arrangements, or alternatively revealed diseconomies of scale.

Rapid inventory depletion of luxury wine without replenishment, while cash generative, would not have been beneficial to the long-term health of the Penfolds brand.

Cash generating capability of TWE is scant given that growth objectives require working capital and acquisitions.

Availability of tax losses turned out to be an unimportant value factor.

A sale and leaseback of key vineyards would have been unlikely to unlock significant value.
