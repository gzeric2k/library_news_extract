Private equity giant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts is in the prime position to win a recommendation from the board of Treasury Wine Estates after lodging a bid significantly higher than rival firm TPG.

The Treasury board is understood to have held KKR to a price of about $5.20, which values Australia's largest wine company at $3.4 billion. KKR and junior partner Rhone Capital offered that amount on August 4, up from the original solo KKR proposal of $4.70 which became public on May 20.

The board of Treasury and its advisers were still locked in high-level meetings on Sunday night as they approached a final decision, which may be announced to the Australian Securities Exchange as early as Monday.

Treasury chairman Paul Rayner has been under intense pressure after a series of missteps at the world's largest stand-alone wine company over the past 15 months, with a change of ownership now highly likely for the owner of Penfolds, Rosemount, Wolf Blass, Wynns and Lindemans.

KKR and New York-based Rhone lodged a formal takeover bid for Treasury at around 5pm on Friday, while TPG also did likewise in time to meet a secret deadline put in place by the Treasury board and its advisers from Goldman Sachs.

The merits of each offer were closely examined by the Treasury camp over the weekend, with both bids ­understood to have a lower-than-usual debt component because of the unpredictable nature of the agricultural industry in which Treasury operates.

A spokesman for Treasury declined to comment on Sunday.

Both private equity firms lodged indicative proposals in August valuing Treasury at $3.4 billion and made separate official bids after an exhaustive and intense due diligence period over the past few weeks which included visits to offshore operations and wineries around Australia.

Both bids were pitched under a scheme of arrangement proposal.

The decline in the Australian dollar has played into the hands of the US-based private equity bidders, with each 1¢ drop delivering a $2.3 million injection to the company's profits.

The weaker Australian dollar delivered more financial firepower for the final bids because it makes Australian assets cheaper, with the maker of Penfolds and Wolf Blass increasingly likely to end up with an offshore owner.

While both KKR and its rival TPG are building in long-term projections for where the Australian currency is likely to be against the United States dollar for the next few years, most experts believe it will continue to fall, meaning the timing of the US predators is good as they look to rebuild profits should a bid be accepted by the Treasury board.

Stephen Harvey, chairman of Deloitte's Australian Wine Industry Group, said the local wine industry was in for a much better era when it comes to currency, with local exports to become much more competitive on the shelves of retailers in the US and the United Kingdom. "We're in a much stronger position,'' he said.

The Australian dollar slipped to an eight-month low on Friday hitting US$0.8772 briefly because of a slump in commodity prices and fears about Australia's growth prospects. This was its lowest point since February, 2014. It compares with a peak of US$1.10 in mid-2011, with the currency remaining ­stubbornly high for much of the period since then, before its bout of recent weakness.

Treasury itself outlined some foreign exchange sensitivities on August 21 when it delivered its full-year results. Using a spot rate of US$0.93, it stated that a 1 cent change in the currency results in a $2.3 million impact on earnings before interest, tax and the SGARA accounting standard for 2014-15.

It also gave an outline of its foreign exchange risk management approach around hedging for the next two years for both the US dollar and British pound, but in practical terms analysts believe the $2.3 million impact is still around the mark when it comes to the US currency shifts. Stockbroking house Citi says the upside for the entire Australian wine sector is substantial from a sustained decline in the Australian currency, and for Treasury it will translate into better profit margins.

Citi analyst Gino Rossi said on Friday that demand from consumers in the United States for Australian wine is extremely sensitive to the level of the Australian dollar.

"US demand for Australian wine is highly sensitive to the Australian dollar and the US market alone is large enough to bring the Australian wine industry back into equilibrium. This will translate into higher wine prices and margins for Treasury,'' he said.

In 2006, Australian wine producers' total share of the wine import market in the US was 29 per cent at a time when the Australian dollar was at US$0.75. For the 12 months to the end of July it had shrunk to just 18 per cent.

Deloitte's Mr Harvey said during the past few years rival wine companies such as Argentina and Chile had made strong gains in the key US and UK markets at the expense of Australian producers because their own currencies were so weak and their bottled wine prices were extremely competitive on the shelves of liquor retailers in the US and Europe.

KKR and junior partner Rhone Capital lifted an indicative offer for Treasury on August 4 to $5.20 per share, while on August 11 TPG Capital made a proposal also pitched at $5.20 per share.

They both valued Treasury at $3.4 billion, with the rival proposals made via a scheme of arrangement where Treasury shareholders will vote at a meeting on a preferred bid.
