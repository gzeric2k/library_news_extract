Private equity giant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts is in the prime position to win a recommendation from the board of Treasury Wine Estates after lodging a bid significantly higher than rival firm TPG.

The Treasury board is understood to have held KKR to a price of around $5.20, which values Australia's largest wine company at $3.4 billion. KKR and junior partner Rhone Capital offered that amount on August 4, up from the original solo KKR proposal of $4.70.

The board of Treasury and its advisers were still locked in high-level meetings on Sunday night as they approached a final decision, which may be announced to the Australian Securities Exchange as early as Monday.
